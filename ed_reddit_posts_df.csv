fasting is such scam you get to see your dream body for a few days and then gain it all back when you break it i do not know how tf my brain keeps making me think this time you somehow will not gain the water weight back on trust me,1,51
crying because my sister did not eat so basically me and my sister have a routine every night where we make a meal sit down and watch tv while we eat i look forward to this every day because it is the only time i let myself eat it makes me feel better that she is there eating with me so i went all day without eating and once mealtime comes around my sister says she is not going to make anything because she wants to lose weight she knows about my ed so i tell her that if she does not eat then i do not feel comfortable eating either and so we watch tv without eating anything and now i am very upset because i really wanted to have my meal and now i cannot i understand that it is very illogical and there is nothing physically stopping me from eating but now i just feel uncomfortable and like i have to restrict even more does anyone else get unreasonably upset over not having food when they expected it food just makes me act unreasonable and my sister did not understand why i was so upset either and i know most people with eating disorders feel this way too but i usually see things like people who are upset over being forced to eat if i am not eating what i expected to eat that day and when then i get very upset i also feel kind of selfish because i do not really care that she was not eating all i care about is the fact that i did not get to eat my meal i just have this constant need to compete with everybody else any advice would be great or if anyone has gone through the same thing then i would love to hear about it so i can feel better about reacting like this,1,320

is it just me or does this summer seem so much worse in terms of diet amp wl talk i have always been in ed and ed adjacent spaces so my social media explore pages have always been filled with that type of stuff but this year it seems so weird like there is so many people talking about weightloss running working out etc and it is not any explicitly disordered people either it is just the average girl you see on tiktok one minute the mainstream media was haes and body positivity and suddenly it is back to let us get our summer bodies back and worse things that i do not really want to repeat lol like this year has been so intense with literally everyone focusing on weightloss maybe it is just my feed i do not know has anyone else noticed this have we just gone far enough that we have looped back to pre 2018 19,1,161

made the mistake of looking at an old video of me i forgot about i do not know what to flair this i am sorry i am high and a lil spiraly i was in the height of my restrictive ed at the time in hs surrounded by beautiful people severely depressed and hiding it but i weirdly romanticize that era of my life so much maybe because at my lw i was like my most confident i do not know fuck i did not think this would fuck me up so bad right now but i am just seeing myself like man i used to actually be so attractive what the fuck happened to me i literally cannot even look in the mirror sometimes without feeling nauseous i am struggling with restriction again but not losing weight at all and i do not know seeing this just really fucked me up in a way i did not need right now and was weirdly triggering and god damnit ok sorry i just thought maybe if anyone could relate possibly it would be someone here,1,184
i act like a bulimic without being bulimic maybe not the best idea to ask reddit instead of mental health professional but i am desperate and am hoping to get some insight here there is a lot of backstory i could give but i will skip all that and get straight to the facts i have a perfect life i am the epitome of what one would call privileged i am a straight white cis guy ok looking physically healthy i have a degree a job a flat a girlfriend and even a goddamn dog i have no reason not to be happy and yet i am currently trying my best to fuck up my life i do not know how to say it other than i think i might be bulimic took me several minutes to even write that sentence because of how absurd it feels to say something like this i have no idea how to explain what i am doing i binge and i purge quite straightforward so far it is the motivation behind it that is lacking logic if i were truly bulimic i would purge because i would be afraid of gaining weight but i neither care about my weight nor about calories i do not binge and then purge to make up for it i binge because i want to purge because purging makes me feel better so i do not even know if this is bulimia is it some kind of addiction some kind of self harm what the hell is wrong with me,1,261
long story buckle up long story i am sorry anyway so i met my fiancés best friend in january on vacation and from the beginning this dude rubbed me the wrong way we went to a restaurant and he literally did not acknowledge me the entire time we were out to dinner fast forward a few days later still in january he is texting my fiancé and he is wanting to go out for dinner again and he makes recommendations but i am a picky vegetarian with an ed so he asks my fiancé if i like salad which i do not and my fiancé says no because it is a texture temperature thing and his friend goes so basically just carbs got it then this mfer has the audacity to say you know her eating is very restrictive like first of all i met you like literally two mins ago second of all i have struggled with ed all my life  i am 26 and 3rd of all who the hell are you to comment on my freaking eating habits so fast forward to april when we go on vacation again and me and my fiancé get into a fight about how his friend wants to go out to eat again and i say i want to stay at the house and relax and have some me time and my fiancé like completely forgot how his friend acted in january like i literally had to tell him go look back at your texts with him and you will know why i do not like him and all he said at the end was i am sorry i did not know you felt that way but like he also did not stick up for me or defend me in that text conversation all he said was i know like dude you know my history with eating and your friend does not and that is all you are going to say i just feel invalid right now i found out my fiancé chose this friend to be his best man at the wedding and apparently it is non negotiable and i just hate that someone that did not even acknowledge me or talk to me is allowed at my first and probably only wedding like am i being out of line it is been replaying in my head ever since january and it will not stop,1,405

everything triggers me to some extent and i hate how social media aggravates it severely i think this is my first post on here do not know since i rarely use reddit and have not checked my acc in a while but now i am crawling into this community to share some thoughts that fkn torture me endlessly i have not slept and i may not word this well but my phone being alone being with others art music exercise scrolling throught the comments of a music video because hey the chick singing in the video is underweight as fuck and there is doom in my stomach and heart as i watch her dance and perform the comments they love her style is it because she is skinny does being skinny make their attraction strengthen does she look healthy to you these people sure love to defend them yet they will never really know how severe complex and secretive this shockingly common disorder is looking at clothing online i do not look like these girls they look human i look inhuman in reflections why is my body type never shown what is my body type are my ribs really that wide why cannot i look normal do i my torso feels compressed my hip bones so tight why is my face so round at a low weight while these girls have the structure i so desperately want my neck is too short what even is a short neck pinterest instagram tumblr twitter you name it i feel like i see most people praising those who are thin those who are severely underweight and likely in their most unhappy stage of their life mentally wise i have been trying to recover and obviously as torturous as it can feel sometimes i have moments of actual joy i will try foods my family offers me it is nice to try i will allow it and i realize i am okay this is normal maybe if i act normal i will see myself as normal momentary glee freedom and then sudden triggers i do not know belsjd aaahhbsigh fuckb also i binged today un yeah hnnn fuck,1,364
two screaming voices i am so sick of having two voices in my head considering screaming for attention and at each other one says i should eat less and that i am greedy while the other is always bemoaning the fact that i am hungry it is making my attempt to recover impossible plus gt the scale still says i have gained even though i am still eating below my tdee and everyone told me it was water weight but it is been a week lt,1,86
i do not even really enjoy b p ing anymore but i cannot stop i do not know what to do i am embarrassed by my problems but i feel controlled by my need to b p i skip seeing my friends so i can have more time to binge i unlocked the ability to purge well and now i cannot stop do not ask me how every person is different and i do not want anyone else to be trapped like i am i want to tell my therapist but i do not even know where to start i hate to say it but things were simpler when i was just restricting i love ednos,1,116
b p is hell because why is it wrecking havoc on my body and my bank account all at once i hate hate hate it so much it is like an addiction atp the urges are so hard to resist and it has gotten worse with those two minute grocery delivery applications and i cannot delete them either fuck me that is it i needed to get it out of my system,1,72
i need to nip it in the bud i have struggled with body dysmorphia disordered eating and anxiety depression since i was a teenager i find myself going back to the same urge to starve myself to gain some type of self worth how do i overcome this either i binge and hate myself or i starve myself and i am a she will of a human there is never a good balance and the days i do starve myself i drink myself to sleep i do not know what to do at this point i know i need therapy but i do not know who to go to or if i can even afford it i feel pretty hopeless and stuck in an endless cycle i have been living for about over half a decade now i feel like i am speaking into a void here whatever,1,148
listening 2 coworkers next 2 me rant about diets and whatnot chat they are joking about heavy restriction and bulimia i want to crawl in a hole in the desert and shrivel until i reach my ugw i guess i could have moved but it would have veen weird talking about starving for a month man is this a sign to get worse no but it feels like it someone is going on a juice cleanse and the other yapped about keto they are not skinnier than me but atp they will,1,92
found an 1 year old photo body check photo i am sad that i cannot be happy about it tw body checking today i was clearing out my google drive photos to make space in my google account and i found this body checking photo from march 13 2023 one is from the front view and one is from the side and i stared at it for so long i was at my highest weight i still owned the exact pair of skinny jeans and the long sleeve shirt from the photo and i decided to put them on and do a comparison the jeans used to be tight on me in the old photo i was wearing shape wear tights underneath and the shirt was rather form fitting today the shirt is baggy and i can actually pull the jeans forward and fit both my arms down with ample room i do not know i feel proud really proud actually part of me wants to share it online and pass it for typical weight loss progress but i know i will get the comments and i just cannot deal with those right now i just want to be proud and have people share my accomplishment with me but i know they will not and that hurts so much i feel like i cannot be happy for myself because i am disordered i just want to be allowed to be happy,1,241

reactive eating despite not restricting i have been having trouble with reactive eating lately even though i eat my maintenance at the moment i do not know if i am looking for advice or just need to scream into the void but it fucking sucks because not only do i feel invalid because i am maintaining duh i also overeat on the regular and my disordered brain is screaming at me has anyone experienced this can offer advice on how to get this under control upping my calories is not going to do much since i am already eating at maintenance at the moment and it is taking a massive toll on my mental health,1,115
am i healthy i have never had proffesional help recovering because despite having an ed for 4 years no one takes me seriously because i am not underweight i am trying to recover but in thr last month i have put on 7 pounds and its noticable so i need to know is 102 pounds at 14 years old and 5 feet tall a healthy weight or am i overweight,1,70
doctor says she needs my weight or will not see me anymore is this true she said it is a requirement that i weigh myself there i do not want to do the thing where i turn around and they write it down either i do not want to be weighed and she is not prescribing me any medication so i do not understand why i need to be i am also 18 and this is a pediatric doctors office so many that is why i do not know edit the main reason i am uncomfortable with being weighed is because during previous visits she told me that gt i had lost a lot of weight lt and i understand that everyone in recovery is different but for me knowing about any weight change in very triggering and i told her that but she insisted it was fine because she was not using numbers,1,154
being pear shaped i hate that no matter how much cardio excerise diet i do i will always be pear shaped even at gt  bmi 19  lt i still had much bigger thighs and looked even more disproportionate due to how much upper body i lost i wish i could get lipo or something on my legs,1,57
i just purged for the first time in nearly 10 years trigger warning writing this into void not sure if i am looking for advice or just a place to rant it is my first time posting on reddit and in this sub so i am really sorry if i unintentionally violate miss something for some context my journey with bulimia started in middle school after a classmate of mine shared to me that her mom purged i did not have a lot of supervision at the time and was home alone a lot at its peak it lasted for about 4 months and i told my dad about it and he made me promise to stop it maybe happened a handful of times in hs but i really thought i was over it and honestly that because it did not last long it was not a real ed struggle jokes on me anyways through my adult years i am 26 i have always wanted to lose weight at least at some point every year i have been overweight for my height at times but never a because for too much concern and i generally get a lot of praise from family friends and others about my looks body even though i can never internalize it so it is just words to me over the last year i have steadily lost weight and am at a healthy bmi a little higher bf this past month though i have really kicked things off more intensity with my physical activity started with a juice cleanse and now i am back to counting calories today i did not even binge or eat anything crazy and yet i purged for the first time since hs what is worse is i was disappointed not more came out i am just frustrated because i would love to have a healthy relationship with food i feel too grown for this but unfortunately i find myself back obsessing over what i eat thinking about food constantly i am supposed to go to dinner with friends this week and that is giving me a lot of anxiety not being able to control oils butter added sugar etc sorry this was so long but i guess my point is that i feel like i am beginning back down a dark path and i do not know what to do,1,399
lost period i have never identified as having an ed but now questioning myself trigger warning weight my boyfriend is a certified trainer and nutritionist when i met him feb of last year i was 168 pounds in october of last year i decided i wanted to lose weight i am now at 125 pounds this month my period was mia i have never experienced this in my life and when i look online it seems like my weight loss might have something to do with it i am exercising vigorously everyday and eating about 800 1000 calories i am slowly losing now around 4 to a pound a week i do not know what i am here for i am just really upset that something i thought was so healthy for me is resulting in a lost period i am about to turn 30 and having children is really important to me and my partner i tested negative for a pregnancy test but that was about 1 weeks ago ago so i am going to test a second time regardless of the result i am making a gyno appointment i am feeling so confused thank you for reading,1,199
for adults in the uk when did you get hospitalised treated seriously generally scared and i know that eds are serious at any weight but the national health service does not necessarily see it that way so i am trying to get a general idea of what people have gone through,1,51
funny how reality can shift it is so crazy to me because i have caught myself so many times saying that gt  100  lt cals is high which looking at the big picture and how much someone with my height and age is recommended to eat gt  1800 2400  lt gt  100  lt is not that much i just find it weird how much my ed mind can shift reality and so little becomes so much i have also want to ask for some low cal snacks no veggies or anything like that though maybe things i can add to yogurt or something anyways thanks,1,105
if you are weight restored do you still eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day i feel like normal life does not allow for it like i will only have one lunch break at work or i have a lie in and it is too late to have breakfast and a morning snack i feel like non disordered eating means having a bigger breakfast when you know you cannot have a morning snack or just eating when you are hungry no matter how many meals and snacks you have but i struggle to eat enough without the structure or end up really hungry at night because i have not eaten enough in the day,1,115
please reassure me about oats just to be clear this is not recovery related it is more a harm reduction type thing oats were just about the very first thing i cut out at the start of my anorexia and i have not eaten them in years however so many healthy recipes use oats and i want to get over my dislike of them do you guys have recipes under 300 calories using oats or ways that i can start dealing with them so many safe foods i see on reddit are made with oats and surely they cannot be that bad right,1,103
falling back again sucks well the past several months i have done pretty good and me and my partner are going through a rough patch and it is like i took a nose dive down when this started and i cannot seem to pull myself out of it between restricting and purging it feels like i am dying i am sure my depression is bad too but i have no energy and feel wiped out as soon as i get up i am also shocked at how fast i got to my lowest weight it is shocking kind of and i want to do better but then again i do not i feel like my ed is all i have since everything else is so good at falling apart it is just kind of frustrating because i thought this relationship would be the one to last and it may not be and it is kind of made me flip out in a way between losing weight extremely fast i have several dangerous habits to stuff like trigger warning sh drugs smoking and alcohol sorry for the vent i just wanted to get some of this out it is like everything is so chaotic and messed up again and it is painful,1,211
not counting calories is so freeing it is also kind of difficult because i want to know exactly how much i am eating but it is so much better not having an exact number looming over me all day and obsessing over how much i have left i overeat way less when i am not counting,1,56
anyone else an anorexic drug addict i do not even know what i am trying to get off my chest but since discovering amphetamines opiates a few years ago it is all i want to do they take away compulsive thoughts about food and i lose weight so fast i will not give numbers or be too specific but i feel like the two diseases have merged and there is no way out i am getting help and have been sober for a while but the weight is coming back and it is making me lose my fucking mind,1,99
belly fat i fluctuate with my weight a lot and even though i have been running and walking and eating less i still have belly fat i have tried upping my protein intake and all the work out stuff and i still have belly fat like it seriously triggers me so much when i was at my lowest weight i still had belly fat like i do not understand how much more i can starve myself to have this belly leave me alone,1,83
sudden realization i am not capable of doing the same disordered habits i did this time last year because i am not as sick as i was this time last year and that is good actually like duh right this time last year i had so many more rules than i do now i also had so many more life stressors that were beyond my control than i currently do this time last year i was having a hard time resisting purging i did not even need to binge to want to purge the exhaustion and pain were cathartic the calories were barely a factor now i cannot bring myself to even try the feeling i was chasing then is too terrible now i had so many rules about workouts and steps and i am not sure when i stopped following them but i have stopped feeling as bad about it i used to view a day to myself as a series of hours to privately burn as many calories as possible through whatever means available i just cannot do it anymore days to myself are now more about rest and when i feel up to it indulging in activities i actually enjoy this time last year only weight loss related activities were enjoyable i forgot what it was like to have other interests i am not going to pretend i feel amazing about the weight gain but i am getting closer to accepting it and hope to one day feel neutral about it i am not a failure for my new habits and routines i am not a failure for gaining weight i am not a failure for not getting sick enough before getting better i miss the reassurance of the old numbers on the scale but the new ones hold less power over me,1,306
i do not know what is wrong with me feeling hopeless i have been eating at maintenance for a few weeks now mostly out of necessity of my circumstances i have just been feeling like everything is a blur i keep good contact with my friends but i feel them all slipping away and i do not know what to do i am worried about one of them specifically he has been really distant and i am one of his only friends here and i do not know what to do to help him because his gf is long distance i am not interested dw i am far to entrenched in my mental physical illnesses to worry about affairs of the heart one of my closest friends seems like she is mad at me i do not know for sure i feel like it is my paranoia and reading into it too much my brain feels like it is not functioning at normal capacity it feels worse and slower than when i was eating like gt  500  lt calories a day another one of my close friends never responded to me she responded initially then opened my second one but never responded the hardest part about all of this is the first friend i mentioned is the only local friend i really have that does not know me from the before times pre ed he also works at the same customer service job i do which is how we know each other i do not want to overstep in our friendship since there is also that professional aspect to it if that makes sense i have other friends locally but i knew them before i lost weight they make me uncomfortable with their comments so i prefer to not hang out with them i feel like my life is falling apart i am in my mid twenties and i am spiraling and feeling like i am a teenager no offense to teens here just a rant i guess i am also starting my period so that is probably the because of all of this lol plus i genuinely feel like i am dying hoping it is just because of the period though lowkey kind of scared but ah well,1,379
going away to treatment for the first time advice going away to residential for the first time ever i have not had a relapse since childhood and just sought out help any advice or support i have no clue what to expect,1,42

nobody has noticed i am underweight and it hurts i have not ent been underweight since i was younger and my disorder was at its peak i ended up recovering and i was slightly overweight i posted here before about a situation with my friend and how i am currently underweight as her comments and behaviour triggered me and nobody has noticed i feel invisible i do not nt want them to know i have relapsed but no comments about my weight have been made or my eating despite the fact i do not fit a lot of my clothes anymore it makes me think i am really not sick enough and that nobody cares i did think about it more and realised i have not worn anything body tight or slim fitting since december and only wear baggy clothing and hoodies but i still feel hurt i know this does not esnt make sense but it is really doing my head in and i needed to rant somewhere they have noticed my sister lose weight and have just been focusing on her and its so triggering hearing them talk about how worried they are and how she does not eat anything i feel bad for feeling hurt about it,1,210
what is something embarrassing your ed has made you do i have a lot but here is one i did today i washed the food i got from my school s dining hall in my dorm bathroom sink today just in case the food literally just vegetables and the whites of boiled eggs from the salad bar were contaminated with other calories,1,62
boyfriend almost left me because of my recovery belly i just need to get this off my chest trigger warning for body image talk discussion of gym and dieting disparaging comments about weight and body type i am 26nb bf is 30m i have been in recovery off and on but mostly on since 2020 i almost died from my ed and i had to put on weight to survive i met my boyfriend in 2022 and we did not start seeing each other until 2023 by this point i was well into my recovery and i have a pretty prominent belly after several months of dealing with complications from a chronic illness i was finally ready to get myself on a healthy path so i started going to the gym 3 times a week for anywhere from 35 minutes to an hour just whatever felt good for my body that day my boyfriend is very fit super muscular he looks great and he knows i am insecure about having a softer body than him and he had assured me it was okay and that he thought i was beautiful well not so much last friday i happened to mention that i do not really enjoy going to the gym and i just do it because i know it is good for me and this caused a huge rift in our relationship where he began accusing me of lying about caring about my health to impress him neglecting to acknowledge that i have had long periods of my life where i have gone to the gym consistently before i even knew him he said he does not see a future with a person who does not care about their health i argued that me not loving the gym does not stop me from going and my whole reason for going is to get strong and build muscle he does not see it that way he believes that i am doing it as a performance for him and that i will stop going once i feel i have appeased him i was so baffled by this when i was struggling with my extended illness i kept telling him how excited i was to reclaim ownership of my body and pursue wellness over thinness i was being honest i still am i was so confused as to why he was so adamant about fitness all of the sudden when he never pushed it before and that is when he dropped a bomb on me i love everything about you except your gut i immediately began sobbing this is my biggest insecurity and he is well aware of that i told him that i would be dead if it was not for this belly and that i thought he was different from the other people who judged my body and pushed their body ideals on me in the past i am not any different from them i am just like all of the others it is cartoonishly maniacal it is evil i asked him if he was trying to get me to leave him because i could not believe how cruel he was being he said he was not but i am still not certain i do not even remember how we ended the argument but it was not satisfying he very nearly walked out the door i should have let him but i asked him to stay last night he was lying next to me and he rubbed my stomach and said you are safe here with me i immediately recoiled started crying and told him not to touch me there safe when you just told me that our relationship is hinged on whether or not i lose my gut after he sulked for a while and when i asked him if he was okay he said i am afraid to touch you i replied well i am afraid to let you touch me good feel horrible for making me hate my body all over again when i was just beginning to see hope through my eating disorder feel horrible for making me cry whenever i see myself in the mirror just like i did before recovery feel horrible for being shallow and selfish and caring more about physical appearances than everything else i have to offer i am so devastated i cannot be with a man who views me this way i will never be able to undress around him or wear fitted clothes or my favorite crop tops i will never feel beautiful with him again i love him so so much but i cannot be with him if i am reminded of my biggest insecurity every time i look at him this fucking sucks edit i just wanted to say thank you all so so much for taking the time to validate comfort and encourage me you have no idea how much it means to me i always know that this sub will be here for support in my worst moments i am overwhelmed by how many of you guys took the time to respond i will try to reply to each of you but it may take me a while thank you again for everything,1,877

ed appts minors hi everyone a couple hours ago i had a big ed appointment it was a full evaluation with a doctor dietician it also determined whether i am original poster or ip during this appt the doctor asked me if gt i count my calories have a goal weight binge what i ate yesterday   lt etc she never asked my mom to leave the room during this and so i lied about everything as there are some things such as those i really do not want her to know at all i was wondering if this is a normal occurrence for all minors in ed treatment since i feel like this can make it hard for us to get real help if we do not feel comfortable sharing everything thank you all have a nice day,1,138

fat girls with happy lives are my biggest trigger i do not care about underweight girls or other people with ed who are skinnier than me woomp woomp your legs are thinner than mine who cares what triggers me the most are bigger girls with amazing lives good job doing great at uni in a happy relationship a lot of friends traveling the world better at my hobbies being confident and stylish all that while being overweight i am happy for them but it makes me so fucking jealous and just hurts my mother always told me no one is going to love me if i am fat i was bullied as a child for being chubby had problems with making friends developed that stupid disorder and damaged my body yet their lives are 100 times better than mine and they did all of that while i was wasting my life on being miserable mess they make me feel like i am either highly unlucky in life been lied to by society that my body is the problem or that my personality is in fact the root of all my failures it should be me i sacrificed so much i was working like a dog it is so unfair i should be the happy one for once please god let me get what i want at least once aaaaa,1,229
the worst thing has happened i work at a gas station my stomach has been real mad at me for what i have been doing to it i have been chugging monsters to get through the day and i felt a rumble in my stomach usually i am able to hold it for a while today was no such day i had to run to the bathroom while in the process of shitting my pants thankfully it was not too bad before i got to the bathroom but i think i will have to go home and change after my coworker gets here,1,103
eating clean is hard when i make myself restrict too low all i do is binge twice my maintenance when i make myself eat enough and get enough protein all i want to do is eat nothing at all eating enough is so inconvenient too i feel like i am forcing myself at every free chance i get to eat i am not even hungry but i cannot gain muscle lose fat if deficit too large i can eat to my tdee in healthy food and still feel a numbness dissatisfaction   maybe i am just not cooking good enough meals ig,1,101
do you all have these symptoms too i have been struggling for about 5 or so years and i swear to god i have only recently had these issues every time i tmi use the bathroom i get up and collapse back down again because my legs and my feet are asleep also when i get up it is like i go blind my head feels hot my vision gets blurry and fragmented and i will stumble because my eyesight just goes so fuzzy,1,84
it is so so so hard to be disordered at a normal bmi and be at a consistent normal bmi it is so annoying god last time i tried to recover and tried to gain weight to bulk up so i can properly work out and maybe start my recovery from there but all my body did was maintain its stupid weight but i was still a disordered ass so when the time came that i acutally gained a little weight i panicked so hard and started restrictive eating again this is so frustrating i do not know if my eyes are fucking with me but i literally look so much worse than before and i have not even gained that much why is my body like this i hate it so much,1,133
why do you do it i fear the reason i do what i do why i keep justifying and engaging in my ed is because i feel so out of control otherwise i have comorbid diagnoses like most it is not just ana b p i am also autistic and severely depressed i have long suspected that i use restriction as a means to cope with that i have been in treatment for my depression since i was 7 8yo i have never really had any success with it i have tried countless php iop ip stays 20 cocktail after cocktail of medications and combinations thereof self medicating vs completely stone cold sober it does not change except during an ed relapse for some reason relapsing gives me probably the illusion of a sense of control and initiative over my situation that i have not been able to replicate outside of relapse but my mood swings go away i genuinely enjoy living and i can keep getting up in the mornings so how do i recover if my depression is so treatment resistant that professionals just tell me there is nothing they can do i cannot access treatment for my depression through traditional channels i am being treated like it is terminal if relapse keeps me just stable enough to stop my suicidality but will also turn around and kill me in the end what do i do,1,238
overshoot i am a month into all in and i have gained a lot of weight i am terrified of overshoot and i would love to hear your stories did you overshoot if so by how much how did you deal with it,1,43
how to cope with a nondisordered person not being able to eat i am talking about the people who say go through a break up and bring up how they cannot bring themselves to eat anything i personally never been through a break up like that where it is left me in such emotional distress they obviously are going through a hard time not like i can say do not bring that up with me because you what to be there for them i do not want people to feel like they have to tip toe around me with what they say but it is a little triggering i do not even know to what extent do they mean by this you literally have not ate anything,1,127
every time i eat i tell myself i will not purge and then i do i will tell myself it is ok to eat for whatever reason i lost weight this morning i have to focus on something i feel weird just one meal will not make a difference you get the idea so i eat something healthy and then i am still hungry so i have some yogurt and by then i am starting to get distressed at how much i have eaten but i still do not feel satisfied so i say fuck it one more snack will not hurt and then i realize i have fucked it up so i eat more to make it easier to purge i purge tell myself i am done for the day and repeat i am getting so tired,1,138
anyone else handle heat worse than cold the stereotype is that anorexics are cold all the time but heat is even worse for me cold makes me miserable but heat makes me sick it is in the upper 80s f 30 31c in my area and i am back to feeling totally unable to function in the heat i blamed it on my weight being too high the last couple of years but i am very underweight now and it is just as bad i feel miserable in the heat anyway but then any bit of extra physical effort sends me into this weird reaction where i think something happens with my blood sugar and i feel really sick if i do not get cooled down it will not be long until my stomach involuntarily rids itself of all its contents some of it is definitely just me and goes back as long as i can remember as a kid i would not sweat very much i would just turn bright red and then puke but restricting does make it worse for sure,1,183
avoiding the inevitable tried trying to recover and restore my period but i know deep down that my attempt at doing so is so half assed i am still engaging in disordered behaviours amp stuck in an aggressive relapse recover cycle but i just cannot see any way out it is so so draining and i literally know there is no point losing weight again when i will eventually have to gain it back to be healthy but i cannot stop myself it is currently exam season and my whole aim for recovery the last time around was to have less food noise stress so i could study better but i have just failed at that so miserably and now i cannot concentrate the worst part is being self aware because it is my fault and the only person who can make me eat is myself but i am so disgusted by my weight gain over the last 2 3 months and the knowledge that ill have so many social events to attend to right after my exams end is making me worse than ever i just wish i could flip a switch and stop all this nonsense man,1,199
at what point do you stop having an eating disorder and start being just a normal person with body image issues i used to have a restrictive eating disorder i went to therapy and gained the weight back but i essentially lied my way into getting discharged my thoughts are still somewhat similar and i am still actively trying to lose weight but i am at a healthy weight eat a few hundred calories more never really ate below gt  1000  lt in the first place exercise significantly less and do not plan on returning to the weight i was at during the height of my ed i still exhibit a few similar behaviors mostly negative self talk calorie counting obsession over food calories hating my body but not anything as severe as before do i still have an eating disorder or am i just a normal person that wants to lose weight,1,153

when increasing cals how long until the excess water weight subsides i am not increasing enough to gain anything my dietician told me i can have much more food without weight gain but my scale has jumped drastically amp i do not understand when this will settle my body was used to a good amount of cals but increasing has only made my body confused and face puffy i do not want to trust her again,1,76

what is stopping you from recovering the weight gain i would have honestly recovered long ago if it were not for the weight gain and excessive bloating i just cannot stand seeing the numbers go up especially when they go up so drastically in the beginning of recovery another reason would have to be the fact that no other coping mechanism seems to work as well as gt  starvation  lt its the only way i know to quiet down my thoughts and feelings and instead replace them with obsessive thoughts surrounding something as harmless as food what is stopping you guys,1,101
jist a rant my best friend is so weird around food and it makes me want to rip my hair out ill preface this by saying she very obviously has an eating disorder and was diagnosed she told me and her mom always makes her eat in front of me she says she does not and calls it a diet i love her so much but last year at the beginning of summer i was in recovery and we would both go out to eat together and it was never awkward i would never ever let one of my ed behaviors trigger someone i love so i always act normal around food and do not mention body or weight related things then in august she relapsed and started visibly restricting in front of me and as a result i relapsed too now of course it is in no way her fault that i relapsed but it just drives me a little crazy that she is not more mindful about the things she says when she is around me because she knows i have an ed and literally saw me when i was severely malnourished she recently pointed to some food at the store and was like i use to eat that when i was on a diet the diet she is referring to is starving herself or she used to tell me about how she would survive strictly off ricecakes like do you want a medal she also takes 30 minutes to eat 3 bites of something and always plays with her food like cuts it up and shit i stayed with her family for a while like 2 weeks ago and had a milkshake and a sandwich while she had nothing then her mom asked her what she ate and she said she had a sandwich and a milkshake and then looked at me and smiled like what then her mom was like let us go to a restaurant and she was visibly pissed read that the portion of soup is 465g which is a regular sized bowl btwl and said i personally could not eat that much i cannot translate directly from my language but basically put a huge emphasis on the word personally while looking at me i cannot help but build up this resentment against her because at this point it feels like she is doing this on purpose i do not care about being in competition with her and i genuinely enjoy spending time with her but every time she has to ruin it with some bs and the worst thing is she always says she puts others over herself and is a people pleaser like sorry what people are you pleasing exactly i do not know how to bring this up because its lowkey embarrassing but oh my god it drives me insane,1,479
failing recovery i have a lot of trauma from being in hospitals or being blocked up in hospitals so having this eating disorder has been a real struggle since i refuse to go back into a hospital but i had to leave new york to go back home to connecticut to see my cat because he was putting in the hospital and when i saw myself in the mirror back at home i saw how thin i was and i was really disgusted with it because you could tell i had anorexia face i do think the change of environment definitely help me see what i look like but now that i am back in new york it is kind of hard because some days i look really fat and on other days i look very thin i also was back with a old partner of mine and he put his finger against my ribs and told me not to lose any weight because i was dangerously low and he was scared of hurting me so with that in mind i decided to recover but without the help of doctors which i thought i was doing really well with but i have not been gaining i have technically did not weigh myself to see if i was gaining but i have been measuring myself and i went back down and measurements and i swore that i was eating lot of calories to gain but i think i have been purposely calculating my calories so i can think that i am in recovery but i am actually not i think the craziest part about this is that i know that i am overcounting a lot of the times but i am still going to ask i think the craziest part about this is that i know that i am overcounting a lot of the times but i am still going to ask shock when i do not gain any weight i know i definitely did gain a little because my stomach is not as concave as it used to be but i noticed that i did gain a little bit and that it went down and i think i did that to myself because one of the pairs of jeans that i take pride in that fits me started to get tight on me and i got scared that my midsection was growing too big so this week i was so shocked when i look like i went back downand weight knowing damn well that i did it to myself on purpose i was talking to my manager about my recovery and how i was not gaining weight and i told him the amount of calories that i was eating per day and he is surprised said really are you sure so that means people know i am bullshiting and i have also been walking a lot more on purpose to further train stops than i need to just to add a few steps in and i have been exercising in my room almost every day i want help because i do not want to die but i also do not want help because of how big i look to myself,1,540
my boyfriend 18m is fully recovered weight restored he is so much prettier and thinner than me 17m it feels so unfair and i cannot stop comparing myself to him i feel like compared to him i look so big and average looking i am seeing an ed therapist in 2 days and this is the first thing i am going to talk about but it hurts so so so bad,1,71
i hate compliments for some reason even though i love the recognition and the confirmation that i have lost weight another big part of me hates when anyone says anything about how much weight i have lost or how skinny i am i love a part of it but for the most part it just makes me annoyed and a little bit angry does anyone else experience this as well if so why do you think you feel that way,1,80
i literally feel like i can never eat or drink anything i am never safe i feel chubby and bloated literally no matter what i consume if it is more than a fucking granola bar or 10 oz of liquid i feel like my stomach is 4 inches wider i do not know what to do i have to eat but it just never ends i am not overeating so i do not actually gain weight but every time i eat anything more than a snack i feel so bloated and it puts me in such a bad mood,1,99
vanity ed so i am just wondering if anyone else is weight obsessed for vanity and if you are doing it because you feel better and more attractive skinny and keeping a figure of what you consider to be of a younger version of you i do not necessary get dolled up i am a jeans and shirt and minimal makeup girl but being skinny is literally the only thing that makes me feel good and gives me confidence but if i am doing it for these reasons does that count as an ed or is it just a vanity thing,1,101
i feel like my ed is the last thing keeping me successful when in reality its the opposite all my peers are doing so well my best friend got her drivers licence and is giving her new friends rides my history class buddy is graduating early and going to school to be a nurse my english class buddy is doing extremely well in class and extracurriculars my friends are all so social and friendly and pretty and have people wanting to spend time with them and date them and talk to them i feel like this disorder is the only thing that gives me strength and success when in reality it makes me weak and dulls my mind i know i need to stop comparing myself to others but i just want some sense of accomplishment and each time i see the number on the scale decrease or i see a bone stick out a bit more i feel like maybe i am as good as everyone else if i cannot be smart or pretty or social i at least need to be thin someone save me from my mind,1,190
the reason i keep failing to recover i have made multiple attempts to recover from an and i do really want to recover but something consistently prevents me from sticking to it for more than a week my boyfriend yes i know this makes him sound horrible but it is true he just keeps triggering me he also has an but refuses to really acknowledge how serious his is and refuses to acknowledge address disordered behavior multiple times he has personally asked me to attempt recovery even stating that he will try as well as sort of a bartering tool not out of a genuine want to recover and i do not think he realizes that he is one of the things holding me back i often cook for him when he comes over which he does often and in order for him to not refuse the food i cook him i have to give him glorified restriction meals and detail every ingredient i add however i am also a volume eater i need to have a full stomach to feel full he eats tiny tiny portions so i often either have to go extra hungry or eat additional food that is really high volume like a whole extra salad and drown in shame while eating it in front of him basically i am forced to restrict for two he also constantly voices super disordered thoughts and i have to offer him so much support for his ed hearing someone constantly echo the kind of thoughts i have only affirms them in my mind even outside of my own head i cannot escape eds he also gets angry at me when i try to offer any sort of reason or try to disprove anything he is expressing all of this would not even be that much of an issue if he provided even a little bit of support for me in exchange but no anything more than a simple acknowledgment that i have an spirals into him getting so upset that it turns around into me giving him support and comfort for his own ed and letting him vent recently i committed the grave sin of explaining to him not even in much detail why i would not eat the candy he gave me right that minute it was a really rough day for me and i just could not have it and i did not want to be an ass and keep him in the dark so with permission i explained what was going on yeah he got so angry not even sure what specifically at that he would not speak to me avoided me physically this happened while on campus and did things that implied he was going to hurt himself safe to say he is not a viable support for me the cherry on top is the fact that he sees my body as ideal and aspirational for himself when he realized i was getting skinny he started subtly bodychecking me it really really messed with me still does i am exhausted all of this makes me feel like any recovery attempt i make will be in vain as he is triggered me out of every one before,1,541
anyone else love trail mix i am talking the real stuff nuts dried fruit peanut butter cups and all somehow it just overrides my ed and i am able to eat my trail mix in peace lol i do not know how long this will last but trail mix is currently my ideal food right now is anyone else a trail mix fiend,1,63

pregnancy with restrictive eds hello i have had a restrictive ed recently diagnosed with an restricting type for over 6 years i am now married and we both want to have children i think i am operating under this false illusion that getting pregnant will solve my issues and force me to recover my husband who sees this from a more clear perspective brings up the point that right now i am struggling to do the bare minimum to move towards recovery he obviously believes that this would be a bad idea right now and deep down i think he is right i see a lot of positive stories about women with eds getting pregnant and then recovering during pregnancy    but i think i focus on that rather than the fact that restriction could lead to miscarriage and other complications just curious what experiences you guys have had and honestly i think i do need to hear some of the negative   so be honest if you are comfortable,1,168
health problems triggering bingeing i have always trended more towards undereating whether i have been actively trying to restrict or whether stress or inattention adhd just contribute to it yes i seek the dopamine giving foods and novelty i have a sweet tooth and can put food away but my snacking is usually reserved to the evenings and it has always balanced out so that even when i am doing really well ed wise and have no desire to restrict it has not really caught up with me enough to because problems when my ed has been at it is worst i have definitely struggled with restricting amp bingeing which i know is super common well mental health wise i had been doing really well for a while but my physical health has taken a downward turn i have some sort of auto immune thing that i have been referred to a rheumatologist for but the blood work indicated that it could be some type of arthritis or lupus my symptoms escalated pretty quickly where in less than a year i went from slight knuckle joint pain sometimes to constantly feeling sore like i have done a super heavy workout the day before my hands face feet amp legs are always swollen and uncomfortable and it impacts a lot of the normal stuff i have got to do like lifting books and heavy paper files is now hard and walking down the stairs in the morning is awful i sleep so much and i feel like i have no motivation or energy to do anything as i said i am waiting for the final diagnosis but no matter what it is i know i have to be more mindful of my diet and try to identify what is triggering flare ups i have not been the most diligent in eliminating any one thing but i am pretty sure gluten is not the problem or sodium just based on what i eat the day before symptoms are bad or mild sugar on the other hand definitely seems to make it worse so does alcohol amp sleep deprivation so i have a very good reason to eat less sugar but i have not been able to stick to it at all i am like compulsively over eating sugar every chance that presents itself i am also staying up too late i am self aware enough to know that i feel a loss of control and that is probably why i am acting out and over indulging there is also the fact that i feel crappy and sad and that also makes me want to seek comfort in satisfying foods which because a cyclical thing how can i get this under control i mostly am posting to get it off my chest to an audience of people who will understand but any advice is appreciated all other sources on how to kick a sugar addiction seem very unhelpful to me so far,1,499
megan trainor i just saw the interview from 2014 where megan trainor says she was not strong enough to have an ed wtf i have seen and heard this kind of rhetoric before and it is so damaging what exactly makes people think eds are a choice it is miserable and can have long lasting health implications,1,57
how do you deal with comments about your weight loss ever since i started losing weight people at work are noticing it is gotten to the point where it is daily multiple times a day people are telling me how good i look asking how much weight i have lost asking what i am doing and more recently making comments about if i am eating or not i am starting to think maybe i am making things obvious but i try not to maybe it is because i have lost a lot of weight in such a short period of time but i have an extremely hard time lying and i do not think it is believable i do not want people to know what i am doing but when people make comments about how skinny i am getting i just want to tell them that what they are saying is not really helping it feeds into my ed more it was really nice to hear at first but i am just getting uncomfortable it makes me feel like people are constantly looking at me and my body i know they mean well but they are fueling my behaviors i do not have it in me to change the subject or say something that will make them uncomfortable,1,218
this mealplan makes me want to start purging so i got a mealplan some time ago and i finally like found peace with it but yesterday it all changed again i need to eat so much and now my father or mother said i need to tell them when i am going to eat so we can eat together i feel awfull and very very nauseous and i even started to like do workouts again and i even considered gt  purging  lt since i do not know what to do i never even gt  purged  lt in the first place but it feels like this is my only option this meal plan is just to much and its only making the voices worse and right now i am only getting physical help so check ups bloof tests and a mealplan and not mentalhelp since the waitlist is very long,1,149
i hate this whole there is no food unhealthier than no food thing online my eating disorder developed because i wanted to be healthy but it ended up becoming a tool i would use to inflict the self hatred i feel upon myself it is no longer about health so i do not know why all these recovery influencers think that the phrase above would help anyone,1,67
questions about therapists i do not have an ed but i think my therapist thinks i have one is it a possibility for them to tell my psychiatrist and general doctor who prescribed my adhd meds to take the meds away from me because they can suppress appetite i signed papers allowing them to communicate and share information back and forth,1,61
dietician wants to meet weekly i am not sure if this is the right spot for this but i am posting it anyway today for the first time ever i went to see a dietician at the recommendation of my therapist i see my therapist biweekly she specializes in substance abuse and eating disorders both of which i have issues with the dietician was really nice but the whole experience was way out of my comfort zone at the end i asked her how often she meets with her clients and she told me weekly and that someone like me should also be seen weekly well that surprised me i told her i am generally doing better than i was a few months ago i do not really binge so much anymore i am still overeating at night restricting and tracking my calories during the day but i did not think that would warrant weekly visits i honestly do not really know how frequently i was expecting to see her does anyone else have experience with dieticians is it common to see them on a weekly basis,1,187
rtc experiences need advice is there any us based treatment for eds that at the very least is trauma informed i have diagnosed ptsd with depression and a lot of intrusive symptoms i honestly am worried i will not qualify for ed treatment at my bmi gt  20  lt but the general mental health programs i was looking at do not let you start without already being recovered is it worth it to go to a general inpatient unit and wait it out until i get placed into a php iop or residential there is a specialized inpatient unit for mood disorders i have a good chance of getting sent to or it could be the state hospital i do not know if there is any way i could plan an admission to avoid the worst case scenario i really would prefer to do php or residential after being told outpatient is not willing to take me on if it helps i am in the age range overlap where i qualify for both pediatric programs and adult programs,1,178
recovered body struggling tried on bathing suits yesterday and struggling very much with body image i have to accept that my recovered body is not the same as when i was sick i still look fine rationally i know that but i certainly do not look the same as i did before i gained weight in treatment and recovery i am a 43 year old mother of two this is how i should look i feel like this body is not mine,1,82
drastic change of perspective depersonalization i think about the world so differently after being engrossed in an eating disorder for a couple of months that i feel like an entirely different person it is hard to imagine food not taking up such a large portion of my psyche but i know that it is possible because i lived that way for the vast majority of my life i just feel like everything changed so suddenly and so drastically it is like i am losing my sense of self has anyone else felt this way,1,94

my eating habits are the only thing i can control right now i am spiraling this is like third post today sorry if i am treating it like a diary but are not we all lol my life has been so fucking shitty lately with school and being in a lowkey abusive relationship it is complicated eating is the only thing i can control right now a part of me wants stay so miserable so i could fall so deep into my ed and be thin and validated and actually worth something in society i feel like i deserve it for letting myself gain weight and be in this situation and then there is a very small part of me that wants to get help that wants to get better ultimately i just want to be fucking happy fuck this life i was given,1,144

my 1 trigger is the fact that my bf cannot pick me up obvious trigger warning for my body image venting things i cannot share with people in my life i have been in semi recovery thinking minimally about my appearance weight but i accidentally fucked it up by scrolling social media and reminding myself of my 1 trigger the fact that my boyfriend struggles to pick me up i know its not his problem but it makes me feel so shitty about myself when people talk about petite girls this and that i am 5 1 but i am like a bottom heavy fatass and not a dainty cute gf you can scoop up i want to be that so badly anyway i feel like shit now and needed to vent weight loss on my mind again sorry for the negativity laughing out loud,1,145
i feel like people see me as bigger than i actually am i do not know if it is just disordered thinking or reality but today i was buying clothes and my grandma asked for my size when i told her she seemed shocked and said she was sure that i was at least two sizes bigger than that i literally wanted to die in that moment i will never forget that for the rest of my life fml,1,79
did not obsessively count calories today for the first time in months i feel so happy i could cry i am not going to lie and say i did not restrict i am eating gt  600 700  lt cals a day and i still made sure i was eating in that range plus i counted breakfast usually i count cals as i make my meal because i do not use an app but at lunch today i was just like fuck it i am literally only eating safe foods i know this is low cal what is the point of counting it now so i just did not and for the first time in months i actually stopped eating when i was full instead of eating everything because i counted it so i have to eat it and i was able to make a portion that fwlt good in the moment instead of adding removing stuff based on hoe many cals are in my budget i was so anxious the last week because i am starting a meal plan soon and i am worried i will never be able to eat normally because i was worried my brain would count automatically but today made me realize although i cannot stop myself from counting individual items in the moment adding them up is a choice i only counted the calories in estimates at the end of the day by using pics i took of the food because of course i cannot just stop cold turkey but it is really making me less anxious about the meal plan and recovery altogether of course this is not really recovery but considering how obsessive i usually am about portions calories food it was really nice to have my brain not be ruled by numbers,1,300
nightmares about being fat i have been gaining weight back recently but i was doing my nightly check in the mirror and such and i was really bloated and i looked lowkey pregnant this kind of entirely shut me down and i just laid in bed and went to sleep i had a dream afterwords that one of my friends had gained a lot of weight after recovering from her ed and i was so scared of her in my dream i would not even talk to her i feel like i am always going to have an ana brain no matter what,1,103
type 1 diabetes amp eating disorders anyone else struggle with this combo i am working on recovering again and realizing how blurred the lines for what i do to take care of my diabetes vs what is eating disordered are i do not struggle with insulin omission in fact i try to take excellent care of my diabetes i would love to hear other people s experiences if there are any most places this is like throwing a fishing line into a swimming pool despite the prevalence of eating disorders in type 1 diabetes the general stigma about diabetes definitely does not help,1,103
mum thought she was helping it was my birthday friday so i went to see my mam for some drinks i already account of those as my only treat because i would just gone on holiday suffice to say i went a little crazy well she also bought me a cake and i could not not eat it while it was infront of me the entire time ended up eating it feeling guilty blah blah well mam could tell i was not feeling great and she said it she said i look so much better now i have gained that my face looks so full honestly not stopped thinking about it since now i am obsessing even harder because i feel i look chubby and gross i hate this so much,1,131

binge eating advice please i need help so bad i started trying to recover around august i got to my ugw and kept losing i looked very strange i finally got what i wanted and did not like the way i looked which is so weird to think from two decades of having an ed since then i have got a bad habit of binging really to the point of almost getting sick and i do not know how to stop i felt okay about how i looked now i am tettering on being too heavy i am not looking for any ed advice at all moreso just healthier ways to not provoke that part of my brain,1,118
anyone else i have an obsession with every snack i eat wanting to be sloppy and runny textures that i can eat with a teaspoon yoghurt i could choose to eat for every meal of the day weetabix rice pudding custard it just provides me with comfort knowing it will take longer to eat and i think i believe i will potentially be more full if i have it instead of my snack being a protein bar before bed like even if you gave me cake to eat i would want it mushy a chocolate bar yes its tasty as hell but where is the mushhhhha i need volume and slop and teaspoon please,1,114
an in real life found my acc an hour ago i handled my phone to one of my uni friends so they could finish something for a class as their data was not working i did not realize i had a notif from twitter you know what side of twitter and well i do not know if they saw the notification and in case they saw it i do not if they actually went to lurk my acc they have an stan acc there and know a lot about subtwts but i still feel terrible for some reason i am ashamed too for more context we have talked in the past about tumblr and questionable spaces media we consumed and i did admit that i had a edblr blog when i was younger so it is not news that i used to struggle with disordered eating and my whole friend group knows i have self esteem issues i relapsed last year around february i was trying to handle it as best as possible with a slight calorie deficit and you know the healthy way but i was isolating myself so i ended up creating an edtwt account at first just to see how different it was from tumblr i found mutuals i cherish i am also on bpdtwt yeah my ed got worst but my mental state is so much better compared than last year around this month i do not know if that makes sense they have noticed me losing lots of weight and are probably suspicious in some way if someone makes comments on my weightloss i always talk about the healthy changes i have done i do not go around talking about it at most i whine about gym and or feeling cold my friend is overweight they does not seem to care about it they just do not care about their physical appearance that way and have a positive food relationship i am afraid this might impact their view on me or it directly affecting our friendship i am not fatphobic besides the i would kms if i was fat feelings i do not interact with fatphobic content neither with minors the most problematic stuff on my acc would probably be meanspo and my own disordered rants but i am so ashamed about having an acc in the first place i do not want to lose it though it is the only place i feel safe i locked my acc changed my handle my layout everything but i am still paranoid i feel like a bad person too and i do not know edtwt does not have the best reputation and it is deserved to be honest but i am not like that i think sorry this does not make any sense english is not my first language and i have not slept in 20 hours i am also hella anxious about this i just wanted to get it off my chest,1,496
grieving with an ed so i have been struggling with food for a long time since i was around 17 so about 3 years i was in a recovery relapse cycle for about 6 months and about a year ago i hit a relapse that i have not been able to shake i am probably the worst i have ever been a little less than a month ago my mom died she had cancer that she would been battling since 2018 it kind of came out of nowhere since she had been tumor free for over 2 years she was diagnosed stage 4 so she is been on chemo since she was diagnosed but her liver started failing rapidly anyway this has been really hard for my family but i have never been able to deal with my emotions in a healthy way so obviously i got worse i had not binged in months before she died but after the funeral and burial was all said and done i broke thus ending a very long restriction cycle and entered a binge purge restrict cycle my weight has fluctuated by the same number for about 3 weeks now losing my mom has been one of the hardest things i have ever gone through especially because we had a difficult relationship one of the things she was always onto me about was my eating she was one of the only people to see just a glimpse of what i am going through and she wanted me to get better and it feels like i failed her i had to leave school before my finals because i could not handle going back while i am still broken over her death while it seems i never know what i am doing i feel more lost now than ever before and i do not know what to do i think this is going to push me deeper down the hole i dug myself and that scares me has anyone here gone through something similar,1,339
shitpost literally i have been constipated for fucking ages so this morning i took a laxative powder thing only to realise after i have caught my brother s stomach bug and have diarrhoea the one fucking day i decide to try a laxative this happens yes it is disgusting but oh my god i am emptying after everything its like when i eat it comes straight out its disgusting but my stomach is flat for once i am not bloated for once like some kind of detox why am i grateful to be ill right now i do not know how to feel i like being empty i do not like the gross part but huh anyways i just find this funny,1,122
sleeping excessively instead of insomnia i went from high res to doing mostly low res during these past couple weeks over the weeks i have been sleeping more and more yesterday i took 4 separate naps all 2 hours plus sleeping through a lot of the night i was only awake for a couple hours at a time and i could barely sit up because i was so tired like i know insomnia is a common symptom but does anyone else get like this instead when they restrict especially doing low res i am getting a little worried especially because it is been making me miss therapy,1,107
tw i think my mom accidently influenced me to have an ed which has also spiraled into me suddenly hating myself again and being unable to look at others the same i am horribly struggling right now all my life or at least for as long as i can remember my mom has always hated her weight gt   5 4 5 6 currently around 200 220   lt constantly talking badly about herself how she feels like crap and so on etc which seems to have seeped over to me i frequently go through fits of gt  not eating at all 12 18hrs no food   lt gt  to not being able to stop eating to a point i almost vomit   lt i hate it so much i hate it even more that i am not able to look at anyone the same anymore i seriously a month or two ago was fine i was loving myself i enjoyed being myself as is gt   5 6 195 205lbs   lt and now suddenly last few weeks in particular i can hardly look at myself in the mirror all i see when i look at myself gt is a blob of fat all i see is the extra everything i seriously feel i look 3 400 lbs   lt i do not know i hate that every time i seem to be getting better i end up getting worse some way or another this sucks,1,240
typical vent post i know i weigh more than most people on this sub i know i weigh more than most eating disordered or what people think of when they hear eating disordered people in general i am on the verge of tears even though it is pretty hard to make me cry because i genuinely cannot fathom how bad i am at this i try to starve and i try not to binge eat but i just seem incapable i know i used to be better worse and i envy those days more than anything every week i watch pounds go up on the scale and it makes me wish i were dead i do not have symptoms of any eating disorder besides bed anymore fuck my life,1,129
i do not get how bodies work especially fat distribution please explain laughing out loud so recently i discovered i could actually see my ribs now which definitely was not a thing last week i have only lost gt  about 6kg  lt putting me at a bmi of gt  23 7  lt my thighs are really big still so how come my ribs are visible now at a normal weight but my tighs remain the same large size i do not get it,1,83
my sweet boyfriend he will not stop making me food or bringing it to me he knows about my ed and is honestly just being helpful he is making me a pizza at his job and bringing it to me after we are both off i was looking forward to have a super small meal tonight i cannot tell him how much this stresses me because i do not want to make him feel bad and ruin yet another thing with my ed like i tried to get out of it but he did it anyway and i just do not want to regret it it sounds so good but i had some yesterday and friday so i am also stressed i know how ungrateful i sound and i swear it will not go to waste i just know i am going to regret eating this,1,146
sometimes i feel like this sub hates me irrational thought of mine i know this sub is not meant to hold my hand or anything but i constantly see my posts downvoted or people just do not reallt like what i vent about i posted about me getting my period and how i felt sad about it and people downvoted my post i am ftm of course i am not going to feel comfortable,1,74
recovering and gaining hurts but even more when your lowest was still overweight i am so overwhelmed and frustrated i decided to recover because my hair was starting to fall out as i was losing weight and it scared me straight now i am eating a healthy amount my hair is growing back and all which is great but now i am gaining too much and it feels like i am back to where i started i am finding it soooo difficult to not relapse honestly it is gotten to a point mentally where i am considering relapsing and just shaving my head if it gets bad which is nuts i know being overweight with an ed suxxxxx,1,118
how do you lose weight healthily after multiple eating disorders i have gained over gt  30  lt pounds since my lowest weight and my bmi is approaching the overweight category my lowest was slightly underweight i am so uncomfortable in my skin it keeps me from living my life i started out more restrictive then developed bed then it morphed into bulimia and i have not been able to lose weight i lost about gt  10  lt pounds last fall and i was starting to feel more like myself but i fell back into depression and gained it back i really hate myself for getting to this point summer is coming so soon and i have broken all my promises to myself if anyone has any advice id really appreciate it,1,131
got back to about the same weight i was 4 years ago and i do not look the same laughing out loud i looked so much better i feel like i have loose skin now tbf i do not really exercise i wish i was toned i am so disappointed and mad at myself i feel lazy,1,57
in person school i am currently in online school and have applied to go back to in person school in the fall i have told myself i need to be the skinniest one there when i go or else i will not make friends and everyone will make fun of me i want to recover actually because i have had disordered eating for almost five years now but i need to be skinny for school i have always been slightly overweight and now i am finally underweight and i just need to keep losing i do not know what to do i guess this is just a vent but i do not know i just want to eat and binge and stuff my face but i cannot i need to lose and the thing is i probably would recover for good if not for the rest of high school,1,149
not even attractive to the male gaze what is even the point of all of this the country i live in has different beauty standards here skinny is what you would call mid sized in western countries and someone who looks like kendall jenner would be called degrading terms here boys do not care about abs slim thighs toned body yada yada the only girls they find smash are ones with huge boobs i have heard boys call so many girls flat who actually have substantial amount of breast then there is me who is sickeningly skinny is actually flat i am smaller than an a cup and no one has a crush on me i look decent looks wise i think but still no one finds me attractive the amount of indirect bullying i have faced is well too much i know a girl should not place her worth on weather boys like her or not but sometimes you just cannot help but feel down so now that ik if i gain weight i will not look pale anymore will get my periods back will get guys will also be attractive to female gaze bcoz i will have better hair n skin so what is stopping me,1,208
how do you refuse to eat out with you are friends or s o without feeling bad i am not hungry most of the time when they ask me to eat lunch with them but the thought of saying no is just as bad as eating food i also really have this person i treasure the most and i do not want to disappoint him every time he eats alone because i do not want to eat i feel so so so guilty it is literally way worse than eating with him also a little tmi i tend to have a sort of diarrhea right after if not halfway eating when i have not eaten anything for a long time that is why i do not want to eat with them i do not know how to handle this situation i am in because if i choose myself i will have bad relationship with my friends and him but if i choose them i will destroy myself further either way i am destroying everything around me,1,176
do people ever try and talk to you about their weight loss i have noticed when i am not doing well and not being mindful of recovery the amount of people regardless of gender asking for advice or validation in their weight loss is wild to me i could be projecting however has anyone else noticed a significant or fair amount of people trying to make conversation around weight loss with you or seeking validation for their triumphs and losses gains etc trying to share their gym regimes or what actually works totally unprovoked just out of the blue speaking to others about my habits and suffering is so far from my mind that when people share their genuine experiences or healthy weight loss stories i am absolutely taken aback maybe even envious they can speak so publicly about it if i dared to share the extent of my experiences i can guarantee my manager would put a section on me laugh my ass off am i alone,1,168
i fucking hate my body i hate my shoulders i hate them so much it makes me look so fucking brute i hate it hate it it hurts me so much that even if i became underweight i will still have this broad disgusting shoulders,1,45
what are your food guilt thoughts what goes through your mind when you feel guilty,1,15
breakup caused full spiral i did not realize it till recently just this time last year i was in a happy relationship and we ate whatever did not matter what weight we were just in love and then when we broke up i dropped like 30 pounds probably from sadness but then from there it never went back up and it just started slowly dropping until now it is been so dramatic i was fit and skinny before we met so i wonder if i am just going back to the way i was before or if this is secretly just triggering something in me since i cannot be with her this is one way i can control something maybe being skinny will bring us back or i can find someone again who knows but at least i am losing the relationship weight,1,143
sad i am about to turn 26 and i i have wasted my youth to this just graduated with my biochem degree my future feels futile and my hopes and dreams feel dead i am so hopeless i do not want to be sick anymore i have tried everything so many treatments i feel like shit,1,56
how valid are undiagnosed eating disorders this past few months i have been really struggling with eating and have lost a bit of weight at first i thought nothing of it i had just gotten off of my anti depressants so i thought it was that but then my pants that used to fit me perfectly got big and i was losing more weight i was a healthy weight then i started really liking the fact that i was skinnier and i had a flat stomach so i just kind of kept not eating as much there are days where i eat normal but then there are days when i might only eat breakfast or dinner recently i have noticed that i am starting to count calories and minimize the amount i am getting daily i am exercising more when i wake up in the morning or get up to fast i get dizzy i have noticed that i get fears over food like i may be allergic to it or something may have happened to it i cannot walk up the stairs without feeling out of breath and tired and i feel cold like all the time the only way i warm up is exercising i also have made a weight goal but have not really been trying to get to it i just like seeing the numbers on the scale go down i told my friends and they brought up the fact that it sounds like an ed and that i should get help but i am scared too because i am not that much underweight and i do not think any one will take me seriously so how valid are undiagnosed eating disorders can i say i have one or should i just go to the doctor and how do i do that without the fear of being judged or turned away i am also just not sure if i want the help,1,326
my running shoes are locked up in my ed psychiatrist s office i wish i was joking fml lol,1,19
thin women lying about weight or delusion does anybody else feel delusional seeing the weights of very thin women i do not follow them but this includes celebrity weights and influencers i just feel like the numbers do not add up i am at a relatively low weight and i have been told by doctors this is in the lower end of the bmi we know that being unhealthily thin is a standard but it straight it feels like it is lying to us when i see myself roughly my weight and height are gt 53kg and 5 5 lt and i see other women with thin arms and legs around my height defined collarbones and their weights are higher these women look excellent but i have seen videos where i genuinely believe they are lying to avoid people copying their thin habits obviously weight is held differently per body type but i am genuinely approaching this from a logical perspective even every girl in my class at university seems around my weight if not less and yet i am being told i am underweight is every woman just underweight and that is normal i genuinely feel like i am going crazy sometimes,1,203
i did everything in recovery and now i am worse tw talking about weight no numbers and a brief mention of a traumatic discharge from ed treatment still trying to figure out tws on here so i guess just read on knowing there might be triggering stuff i am still in denial i even have an ed because i am not dangerously underweight my blood panel before i was admitted was low for example i had low calcium and other things like that so i was not that sick but i new something was off with me in treatment i gained a lot but i was never underweight in fact i was actually overweight for my height and it got higher and i could barely look at myself post discharge i still cannot look at myself without feeling so much anger and disgust i was waiting to step down to iop so i can go back to my old ways nobody seemed to listen to me when i started to get distressed from the weight gain i ate consistently and i kept completing my meals and i fucking hated it then i was discharged and it was really traumatic for someone with attachment trauma now i am just hoping that i can get sicker i am still in my head that i will not get sick and that i can still do my strenuous and exertive job even when i am not properly nourished i have done it before and i can do it again i am more determined now to reach a gw after discharge and i was never like this i cannot tell if entering treatment ruined me or awoken something much worse,1,285
i thought i was eating a ton and it is scary how wrong i was weighed myself for the first time in a week today had a moment of gt wtf how did i not gain i have been eating everything and i was ready to be like is this some kind of medical issue except when i actually wrote everything down   that was true a week ago i did eat everything last weekend broke a several years long streak of recovery from b p with an entire batch of pancakes ate all the fake meat in the freezer cereal a pot of noodles with spicy peanut sauce etc this week i   cannot even remember mostly protein shakes a can of roasted chickpeas 2 veggie burger patties 2 taco tortillas with peanut butter that might literally be it and i did not even realize it i thought i would been eating this whole time not just eating feasting i think i am dangerously not okay lately i cannot articulate how weirdly fucking terrifying it is to feel like i am losing my grasp on reality in bits and pieces edit if another person makes a horrible fucking pro disorder comment about wanting to be in this situation i am deleting this entire account i came here to vent and ask for advice not for voyeurs to get off on my pain and loss of sanity it feels like i have fucking dementia i am sick i am scared my body hurts the last time i was this low it cost me everything i do not want to be sleepwalking through life in a body that is so damaged it does not tell me i am hungry anymore until i am rotting my teeth with vomiting on an empty stomach i want to like food again i want to be able to remember things again i want to be human again this is not human it is closer to being a wild animal that is walking around with most of its guts missing if you had the slightest fucking clue how i ended up here you would feel like trash for implying that i should be thankful for any of this,1,370
does anyone else feel like they are faking i feel like i am not allowed to categorize myself as having doing disordered eating behaviors because i am not thin or look like the typical person with a restrictive ed it exhausting how society and the media has warped our perceptions of how a person that is struggling with food issues is supposed to look it is like if i am not at my worst did these problems ever exist,1,79
can you just gain to the bare minimum of healthy in recovery moderators please delete if it breaks rules i am an adult who will most likely be forced into recovery when i am clearly not ready i cannot fathom the amount of weight they will make me gain and for my own sanity i am praying to god that they will work with me on where i am at which is the bare minimum is this possible will treatment centers be willing to work where i am at,1,89
i am scared my therapist is going to have me eat lunch with him once a week maybe 2 3x if insurance covers he wants me to have gt  1500  lt for one meal with him i am scared because i domt want to gain and i will most likely omad lunch those days i am not even i am recovery i restrict eat 900 most days and ik that eating 1 5k or 1 7k will not impact me much if i am eating 900 cals every day after but still all they want me to do is gain weight and when i gain weight i will have less thoughts bs because when i do i am worse and worse and if i do not bring enough food he will add more from the cafeteria or we can eat at the cafeteria instead of me bringing my food i am tempted to just skip therapy because it dosent even help me,1,162
imagine if i put this much effort into studying something i live in canada we do not have trader joe s yet i know the calorie count of all of the trader joe s snacks because i browse through their site building hypothetical shopping lists as a hobby the amount of time i have dedicated to researching nutrition diet macros etc is actually embarassing imagine if i had this much interest in learning math or something i could probably get a fields medal kidding,1,84

i am slipping back into depression and it is comforting for my ed trigger warning my ed started because i was depressed i an overweight and absolute foodie who gave up on trying to lose weight suddenly did not feel like eating anymore i took advantage of it and avoided food as much as possible to lose weight because i did not crave anything anyways and i developed an ed my depression got a little better in jan and i started eating again my long term restriction got the best of me and i was stuck in a binge restrict cycle until now my mental health still was not good just a bit better and now stuff in my life is getting bad again and along with the ed it has made me slip back into this familiar hell hole of depression again and i lost my appetite again just like that i can restrict again without eventually binging and that comforts me it is killing me i hate living like this,1,172

does anyone else here adult still live with your parents i am 21 years old i started university online for 2 years when the pandemic hit i moved away for university to my dorm for about 4 months 1 semester about 2 years ago now during that time my ed completely went downhill and i had no support and no one to stop me from extreme restriction and b p i was falling apart and my grades showed for it it was impossible for me to focus on school and care for myself during summer break when i moved home temporarily i was so happy my family is what i needed and my mom was so worried about the state i was in when i came home during that summer i focused on me and with my family i was doing amazing and i do not think i b p once i was terrified to return because i could feel myself go back to that state of mind i tried it away but i only made it a week before i called my mom crying saying that i could not do it and that with my counseling from my school pushed for medical leave my mom cried with me and said that she never wanted me to go back there and is so happy and wants the best for me no matter what i do not know what i would do without her support i felt like a failure a drop out but please someone tell me i am not a failure and my recovery is most important right it just looks bad for the people who do not know what i am going through i am still living at home at 21 surrounded by the best support system and drs and dietitians and physiatrists i do not drive so my mom is my main transportation i could not go anywhere in university because of travel i walked everywhere with like no energy my point is i still feel like a failure because of this even though i am the most happiest with my family dad mom and little brother i would not want it any other way we always say there is no rush to recovery when you are ready you will get your licence and try uni and growth on your own again when i am ready i still feel this pressure always to leave and grow up do not get me wrong i am extremely responsible and independent my family needs me more i believe laughing out loud which is nice to hear i do a lot my friends are all graduated now with nurse degrees and one is pregnant i feel extremely lucky to have this support system but i feel guilty i am this old and still live with my parents,1,476
when did you finally start seeing urself as skinny for context i started off obese and i have now lost enough weight to be told stuff like you should stop losing weight you are skinny now if you lose more weight ull end up looking sick or i have people be annoyed when i use words like fat or chubby to describe myself i swear i do not want to come across as an attention whore fishing for compliments but i genuinely do not see myself as skinny i still see a fat person everytime i look in the mirror so its weird to be referred to as skinny so i am curious to know do you actually get to a stage where you start feeling skinny or seeing urself as that or will i just forever look and feel fat,1,141
finding a nutritionist is impossible i decided to go into recovery a month ago i have been eating what i want without really being worried about calories i have gained easily 30lbs since my lw i feel like i have been doing this completely alone i need help with portion sizing and not overeating binging has been a huge problem for me for so long i just want to feel normal and feel good in my own body i hate the way i look right now i want the nutritionist to help me lose weight in a healthy way but it is been a month and we have not been able to get a hold of anyone i feel like i am letting myself go too much i just hate this spot in my life right now this is so frustrating i just want to get better,1,147
i do not know how to deal with recovering i used to have a gargantuan restricting ed in my first year of uni i have since started eating again for a year and i knew that i would put on weight easily i finally started seeing this weight gain 2 3 months ago and although i am probably not overweight i do not weight myself anymore i have body dysmorphia i find myself thinking about my body food and calories 24 7 it is scary in the depths of my ed i did not feel like this and it is not how by ed worked at all i doubt i will relapse but i am scared of what my brain is doing to me this is new,1,127
i relapsed because of one sentence i cannot believe this is happening because i have been recovered for more than a year and have i guess what you would call a good relationship with food i have always been on the verge of relapse because my brother would frequently skip dinner and my dad made comments about how skinny he is which is extremely wrong but it constantly put me in the mindset of competition fast forward to today and my dad is about to go to the store i asked him to bring home protein shakes to which he replied why do you do protein shakes and there is nothing wrong with this comment but my mind took it to the extreme i have been faking sick to avoid eating and i feel like i have made a fool of myself,1,142
i am becoming what i feared sorry if the title is over dramatic but when i was a teen i thought id recover or kms my 18 did not happen in my 19s early twenties i vowed to recover before hitting 24 25 because the posts and videos of people still grappling with this mental illness well into adulthood thirties fourties etc made me so sad i used to lurk in the communities for adults in their 30s 40s parents with eds and i swore to myself that ill get better and it did not happen i am now 26 and to be honest i do not see any hope of recovery very soon i do not know how long can i go on like this i have no hopes for my future as such other than living comfortably with my cats they are the sole reason i have not attempted in years i am scared ill end up like those people i used to see in those communities well into adulthood but still dealing an mental disorder most healthcare providers associate with teenagers,1,184

weird tip to ease body dysmorphia hey this is a really really weird tip that i have found has helped me when i cannot seem to understand what my body looks like in the mirror so basically if i feel bloated or self conscious of my body and it is like really bad cannot look at my body in the mirror without bursting into tears bad i will act like i am pregnant i will put on my tightest fitting tank top stuff it with a bunch of shirts until i get the pregnancy belly look i am after put another baggier shirt over it stare at the bulge in the mirror and lie down it helps feeling the weight of the stomach and it kind of also helps me eat cuz i can pretend i am eating for someone else besides me and then after an hour or more sometimes i leave it on all night i take it off and it sorta helps me see my body right even if it is just for a second it also feels like you just lost a bunch of weight when you just take it off especially if you leave it on for awhile maybe this is just a me thing but it helps on the extremely hard days mainly cuz it is a really silly thing to do and i am hoping maybe it can help some of you much love i hope everyone has a decent day and remember that it will be okay,1,255
fellow autistic people with eds does anyone else sensory seek i 24afab am diagnosed mia and i am also autistic i recently realised the vast majority of times outside of emotional eating my binging was actually caused by sensory seeking i learned that what happens is autistic people can sometimes be hypo sensitive to tastes rather than hypersensitive and they become more alert and engaged after eating foods that play to these sensory experiences it is a form of stimming basically i will name a few examples for me i get a rush out of specific kinds of breads and or pizzas doughy chewy iced coffee cold creamy sweet kettle cooked chips salty crunchy and the spiciest things imaginable but thankfully i have been finding better more beneficial ways to serve those same sensory functions for example i make my iced coffee at home now i have been feeling a lot better physically and mentally and my wallet has been thanking me still got a long way to go because i have not exactly fully recovered after all these years but i guess this is part of the journey how about you guys is anyone else a sensory seeker tl dr i recently learned that in autistic people sensory seeking can be a major because of binge eating for us does anyone else with both autism and an ed have this,1,231

what is that particular brand of misery you have the day after b ping is there someone smarter than me otu there who can explain why there is just this very specific feeling of depression the day after you binge purge it is completely different from a hangover or any drugs i have done not that i have done a lot lol it is this very heavy feeling in the heart i get it when i binge and vomit and when i binge and abuse laxatives it is the worst it is truly just utter despair and while i have depression on top of this stupid ed anyways i am curious because it must be physiological physical,1,117
frustrated with no progress it is driving me mad i just cannot put weight on i put on a tiny bit and then lose it again i do not know what to do i am drinking stupid shakes and eating as much as i can cope with and i just cannot put weight on or keep it on i have not really been in recovery for that long i know a few months max but i am already being driven mad by how hopeless it feels maybe i am self sabotaging somehow i do not know this does not make much sense i guess i am just screaming into the void,1,111

imposter syndrome in other aspects of life anyone else i know most of us struggle with imposter syndrome within our eating disorders thinking we are faking being ill or are not ill enough and once people know we have an ed they will see how much of a fraud we are but do you struggle with this in other aspects of your life besides your illness i just got a huge promotion at work and i keep feeling like i must have lied my way to it and am not deserving of it it is like i am convinced i am a fraud with everything i do i am a fake anorexic a fake good employee a fake everything i am convinced nothing about me is real and the one thing i know diagnostically i am anorexic is just another lie i tell myself to make myself feel like i am something anything anyone else struggle with this not feeling like they are anything but a walking lie,1,168

i think i need help i think i need help but i do not know what to do i am eating less and less every day i cannot stand the feeling of a full stomach and force myself to vomit and excessively exercise whenever i eat over my cal goal 600 i look nothing like the thinspo that pops up on twitter but i feel like i am dying my weight is not even that low but i still feel sick this disorder is controlling my life and my family is unaware i am 16 they have not noticed any of my disordered behavior and i take advantage of that as an opportunity to get worse i do not want to get better i want to be sick but i also know that thinking that way is not right i would like help that is not just eat for me because that does not help and encourages me even more i know i am a bad person for wanting to get as sick as possible i just need ways to cope with the emotional turmoil that this disorder is putting me through and potentially help me from wanting to get even worse this disorder combined with my crippling gender dysphoria is slowly killing me and both things are encouraging the other i do not know what to do please help,1,230

maintaining relationships is so difficult its so easy let this disorder consume you when my friends asks if i want to spend lunch period walking with them i hate saying no but how can i say i am having heart palpitations and stomach pain and all i want to do is just sit in the restroom stall and when my boyfriend says i can be more energetic over text how can i say that the only thing in my head is thoughts of food and numbers and exercise and i only have the energy to lounge around doing absolutely nothing maybe i will be the best friend and girlfriend when i lose weight yeah fuckin right i am thankful there are communities like this so i do not feel so alone in my self constructed solitude on the bright side we recently got a ninja creami so i can have all the low cal sorbet i want yayyy,1,158
has anyone tried or considered antidepressants other medication to help them with recovery full disclaimer i do not have an ed and never have i just have a strong fascination with restrictive ed mindsets as i literally can not relate i am a very empathetic person that is also very interested in psychology and i want to understand and wow have i learned a lot from looking through this sub it is insane how much the general public without eds truly have no idea what you all are going through i do not think there is nearly enough education awareness on eds anyhow what i do have is depression anxiety quite a few ocd tendencies and cptsd i was terrified to try antidepressants but i got to a point where i knew that i was not going to get out of my 5 year long dark hole of depression of not being able to handle life hold down a job friendships without some help with my brain chemistry i would have never tried antidepressants if it was not for my boyfriend who over the course of 3 years really recommended that i give it a shot it is been helpful for sure it takes the edge off of my extreme anxieties and makes life more livable and most of all it makes me obsess less over things that do not matter the obsessing over unimportant things or making things that may be a slightly big deal into a huge deal is a major component in the way of my happiness so my question to you all is if anyone here has considered a route like that a route like a medication that could help your brain obsess over your weight less and in turn perhaps it could make recovery less gutting to go through this of course is a question for those who are wanting to recover i was terrified to take antidepressants because i have health anxiety and i really thought it was going to destroy my health but i am so much healthier than i was without it stress kills you more than you can imagine it is really nice to have this helpful tool right now and i do plan to get off of them in the next year or two or whenever i can handle life and not be so low functioning,1,396
candid photo of me i have been attempting recovery for my family but mostly my mom because she is been so worried about my weight and overall well being i thought i had put on a good amount of weight not sure though as i tossed my scale which i was fine with and even a little glad about but yesterday we went bowling to celebrate a birthday we had pizza ice cream and all the good stuff that comes with a party my mom took a picture of me i used to always avoid pictures but lately i have been trying to live in the moment and not be so awkward i mean in the past 5 years you would be lucky to find any pictures of me that are not at weird angles that totally warp my face because i avoided them so much anyways in the picture i look sickly my skin looks pasty and i appear hollowed out and paper thin when i look in the mirror i feel better but i am starting to wonder if i am just convincing myself of that because i want to be better it is like the mirror is lying to me depending on how i wake up i will either feel skeletal or like a whale and i see that in the mirror i feel like i am convincing myself i am better while still losing weight i am thinking about getting a new scale but knowing me i will just become obsessed with the number i am at a loss for how to move forward,1,268
scared about getting weighed tomorrow i have to go to the doctor tomorrow and get weighed i am not sure what the number is as i do not have a scale but i have been taking a steroid that makes you pack on water weight wisdom teeth ate some bread today which holds water and have not passed any stool so i am freaking out that i am going to go to the doctor and weigh like 15 more pounds than last time and them judge me,1,87
trying recovery scared af i really really really want to recover but i am so scared i have been trying to eat for a week and it is getting harder every day i am ok as long as i am busy but when i go to bed every night my brain starts and every night it just gets worse last night i started to plan a relapse and the night before that i only started thinking about it my birthday is tomorrow and i think that is the only thing keeping me from not relapsing even though i am not even really in recovery i still live with my parents so ig i could get support from them but last night my mom said something to the affect that she was tired of forcing me to eat she is already said she cannot do it again in reference to my recovery i know i will be able to do it but i also know that when life gets hard again i will most likely relapse what are some things that has helped you guys i am trying to stay motivated and because i am going thro finals i actually need to eat but i am worried after that i will stop ik this is all me and i should just eat but i am i am eating sm and ik that i am probably not even but still how do i stay motivated,1,243
how do you guys get anything done i have an exam tomorrow and i am currently laying in bed wiith a headache and hunger pains and i am very much supposed to be studying but i cannot bring myself to get up let alone focus on memorizing and retaining information i see so many people here who are great students or have jobs and i am honestly confused about how anyone does it,1,73
my lips are all fucked up inside from the compulsive chewing i developed a heavy ass gum addiction to combat cravings when i was getting hungry or wanted candy i would chew gum i went through a pack like every 2 days and started getting neck and teeth pains plus it is suuuper bloating and ended up just making me feel worse so i am trying to stop but i am used to always chewing something so now my lips and cheeks are going throught it,1,86
guess who stopped a binge before it happened today figured this might help someone out there for context 22m an r gt  uw  lt but i have recently developed some severe binge restrict tendencies where my nocturnal binges are borderline animalistic and routinely crack 5000 calories which i follow with days or weeks of low res to even out until i average everything out to maintenance for the most part though i eat high res i am really just trying to maintain and eat two meals a day and a midnight snack last night s planned midnight snack which consisted of my favorite protein bars was deeply disappointing for some reason i just did not enjoy it i woke up this morning in a snacky mood and essentially rolled out of bed and grabbed a handful of the same protein bars i would had last night and was fully on the verge of eating half a dozen of them until of course i realized that my longest standing binge trigger is having a dissatisfying meal or snack letting it derail my day and subsequently attempting to mitigate the disappointment with an absolute bender of a binge and further that trying to make up for an upsettingly lackluster snack by binging on the same thing was probably the stupidest most self defeating idea i have ever had so i got up repacked my protein bars into the little containers i store them in and figured i would wait and see if i still felt like snacking on something i did so i thought long and hard about what i would enjoy and settled on a box of blackberries instead they were phenomenal and they put me a few hundred calories over my daily limit and the real kicker is that i do not care at all incredibly proud of this i have never been able to preempt a binge and thoughtfully exceed my limit afterwards without going crazy before and it feels like such a breakthrough,1,335
how did i gain eating so little i have only been having gt  200  lt cal a day and i gained 400g overnight howwww,1,24
well it finally happened i am strapped up to an ekg 2 hours in to an emergency visit after passing out at work and coming to with my hands clenched and unable to move and my mouth tingling i could not walk i felt stuck in my body i could barely breathe my chest hurt this was the most terrifying experience i have probably had top two forsure i am embarrassed i am ashamed i am clinically at a healthy weight and cannot believe this happened to me my partner simply said alright well hope you start feeling better soon aka eat something so you can take yourself home wish i could post a screenshot i am ashamed and embarrassed and here alone because i refuse to be yelled at by my family and partner my coworkers were so supportive and kept threatening to call an ambulance i want to put my two weeks in i want to quit i am so ashamed i can not believe this happend and i just ugh i just needed to vent,1,178
is there a healthy way to tell people about anorexia i just feel so lonely and lost in the void with all of it and i am thinking step 1 towards recovery requires me to actually stop hiding that i am struggling but everytime so far that i have tried to talk to someone about it everything crashes and burns i am underweight have not gotten my period for nearly a year soon and i have assumed its amenorrhea and malnutrition i am scared about it and i feel too dumb to understand anything i read about it i spend a lot of energy hiding my struggling from my family so they know very very little about it i do not talk to them about my problems i have had 3 close friends online that i have eventually known long enough that they start to question why i am being weird about convos with food or whatever and it just becomes easier for me to explain why but then each time the relationship just dies i asked 1 friend for advice about something with my parents she told me everything is okay and that she is my online sister and i can talk to her about anything and she kept pushing and asking questions and why and it just led to me telling her about the eating disorder i talked about amenorrhea and fainting and she just got mad at me yelling at me that if i wanted to be a mother one day i need to eat this goes on for 2 days and i just tried explaining why its not so easy and then she just says she is irritated and mad that i will not listen to her advice about eating and that she gives up i do not want to be a bad person i do not want to be a difficult friend i just want to be normal and nice to everyone i deeply regret ruining the friendship and i feel so sorry can someone please tell me a healthy way to talk about this stuff so that i will not ruin my relationships with friends and family,1,363
does anyone else wish they lived alone so they can not be caught that is the post that is is major thing preventing relapses is having someone that shares my space and i do not want to be caught,1,39
using my teen brother as thinspo honestly i am relapsing and i am just so angry it is stupid lol i have my mom jeans that i used to wear in high school that i got out the men section so technically there men s jeans to my brother because there way to small and he wears them all the time it reminds me how big i have gotten a lot of it is muscle gain and now i am built like a bodybuilder and feel disgusting because i want to be petite and smaller again i never realize how small i was till i was not anymore and he is so thin and i am relapsing partly because i see him in my jeans but i honestly do not care my life s shitty right now and it feels good to go back to old ways right now i just feel like shit because i am comparing myself to my brother and about such a crappy thing so now i am fasting for a week laugh my ass off yay me shake my head,1,185
be mindful of what you say i was in recovery stopped counting my calories and ate what i want i could have a cookie in the morning without any guilt until my friend said to me wow i think she weighs less than you which is crazy because she is taller than you and then the competitiveness came back and i relapsed and it got even worse when she called me healthy skinny even though that seems like a compliment to somebody with an ed it is not i wanted to look sick so yeah just a reminder stop commenting on people weights and bodies even if you think it is a compliment,1,113
i am in hell it is a throwaway account i should be happy because i have an extremely fortunate life but i am slowly having to admit to myself that i am likely anorexic but i cannot stop it or myself nor do i honestly care to i have always been naturally quite tall and lean due to genetics around gt  133lbs  lt eating and living how i wanted but i saw myself as heavy i guess and so i started restricting until i became now gt  110lbs  lt more or less leaving my bmi at gt  16 2  lt i am 5 9 the change is definitely noticeable i have felt missing skin or curves that used to be there and i am happy and i even like my current weight but i am terrified to eat at maintenance or accept food i am tired tired tired lack of energy constant mental exhaustion considering numbers and calories and steps cold more often and sleepy it is uncomfortable to sit even because i became so bony i feel guilty my fiancé might find me less womanly and he says i am still beautiful bless him and he is worried as are both my parents but i cannot stop maintenance is a horrifying thought i jump on the scale with gusto just to cry and body check obsessively just to hate myself i told myself ok only x weight reaching that i thought how about y then it is y minus 1 or 5 or so i used to eat so freely and happily and did not care i cannot eat out without freaking out or making myself guilty i forced myself onto a treadmill before a night out with friends and just mentally chanted at myself repent repent repent for the food i was about to eat but at the same time i cannot stop comparing myself especially to idols from my so is ethnicity i am not of the same race as him they are all so skinny and his race has a different bmi scale i feel horrendously fat and i cannot stop comparing even though i do not even objectively look good anymore after losing curves only to gain bones i am in hell but i cannot stop touching the fire even if it is hurting me exhausting me and so on even if both my parents and my fiancé and others tell me to jump out why should i i cannot,1,415
i feel like such a monster i was thinking about a time when my sister fainted at her house because she was not eating enough and wondered why she was not i never noticed her eating too little i finally connected the dots she was living with me for 3 months and seeing how i ate and how i would brag about my low cal recipes and all that crap she seemed to take an interest too in my weird food i think she was eating less because of me i am always careful about diet talk around children because i am so terrified i could affect them i did not think i could affect her since she is older than me and everyone always makes fun of me for being crazy about food how could i do this to her she actually has a life and children and matters and she is also chronically ill i saw another one of my sisters picking at and dissecting her food the same way i do when i was a young teen i would talk about how much i hate my body and my weird mindset around food around younger kids and i feel like i affected them too i hate to think about how many people i have hurt because of my issues,1,222
has anyone else developed multiple eds separately disclaimer not medically diagnosed and that is not really the point of my post as i understand that this all could fall under osfed ednos territory i am just using these terms to try to communicate what i mean i have ocd and had an extremely restricted diet due to arfid esque fears as a young child which still kind of holds true today then as a pre teen i developed an exercise addiction and began restricting when i was a teen i stopped that and randomly developed a purging problem similar to purging disorder after getting a stomach virus after that i had symptoms like non purging bulimia had a brief period of compulsively eating non food items then a binge eating problem now i am closer to atypical anorexia i can look back and i have basically done everything and even things i have never heard of other people doing sometimes for seemingly no reason one of the earliest things that kicked this off was compulsively forcing myself to eat things that made me sick  combinations of medications boiling hot liquids salt water and vinegar things that my ocd tells me are dirty i really struggle to comprehend how i get over one eating problem and am hit with a totally different one i am currently dealing with extreme fear that i will vomit which seems ironic given my past having ocd is definitely a common theme i did experience child abuse where my siblings and i were forced to eat spoiled food things we were allergic to or just not fed or given too much food anyone else,1,278
never understood what type of ed person i am i am so confident and i truly see myself as beautiful how come do i have bulimia since i was 16 yo how come i have suffered and still do from anorexia it does not make any sense to me never told anyone i have an ed because i am perceived as a very strong woman 26 yo now and i do not want people to think i am weak but when you have your hands covered in vomit with your head in the toilet while your nose is bleeding and your eyes tearing up jesus if only people knew and the worst thing is i do not want to recover i feel like having an ed is the only way for me to stay skinny how desperate but i really love myself so why am i not really loving myself,1,150
the sad but true reality when you are under 18 they will force you into treatment against your will even when you are not in serious physical danger when you are over 18 they will send you away even though or probably in my case because of you are in serious physical danger and begging for help,1,57
counted my extreme hunger calories i should not okay so it is almost 3pm and i ate so much my extreme hunger these days is bad i am in relapse and eat around gt  1150  lt but it is hard and my body is mad at me i know it well hungry all day crying and want to eat today i am home alone so nobody can control me if i do not eat and i do not eat much but to be honest i was so hungry so i just eat sometimes i just listen to my hunger bcs i am so tired of my hunger all days it is like 1 2x in 2 3 weeks it is even extreme hunger i am hungry but not eat something i do not like i eat knowing what i eat but back to my post i counted it i ate like 4 choco bars bcs i am cravings chocolate liek crazy i must have low vitamins so i give up and ate it but then also i wanted so much bread so i had bread i ate at this hours since 10am gt  2200kcal  lt and i do not know what to do i have dinner today and i am still craving food so much i want yoghurt and tiramisu since its my favorite food but i am 2x over my daily limit and my head is screaming at me i do not have nobody to help me there is only my pet that i love but no human who said something my head wants to skip it to not make it worse,1,273
i thought that i recovered but apparently i was wrong i developed an atypical anorexia at 16 when my family situtation was very stressful after 6 years of self recovery i really believed that ed was a part of history i stopped weighing myself accepted my body shape got rid of weird food rules and became more relaxed about how i view myself in general a few weeks ago the ed thoughts started to reappear i feel so humiliated and hopeless   i am working very hard to deal with these thoughts and it requires quite a lot of effort will they continue to reappear will it last till the end of my life i was so proud of myself that i recovered,1,122
does anyone else feel like their ed is ruining their life i feel like i waste so much time and energy on how i look i ben when i am doing better and not counting cals body checking and so on i am spending so much time and energy on my clothes and my hair and makeup and everything i am 18 have been graduated from high school over a year now with no solid plans for college all my friends are in school or have schools they are planning on going to but all i have is a closet full of clothes makeup products and a digital scale my goals for the year were first losing weight and getting a consistent gym schedule and secondary goals were college my entire future feels unimportant if i cannot do it skinny it is actually exhausting i do not want to care about any of this,1,154
guilt after caving into munchies recently i have been getting really high like unable to properly function i also get the worst munchies imaginable and so it always sparks a b r cycle i feel so terrible but it is just such a compulsive need to eat but i cannot stop getting high because i know it helps my ed,1,60
took me a while but i realized the ultimate goal of all this it was never losing weight i have lost weight countless of times in many different ways i always end up gaining most of it back and about 2 months ago i reached my hw this time i am at the height of my depression and bulimia is back to be honest i throw up just to feel something i have lost about 20 pounds in 1 5 months my clothes fit better and i can actually feel my bones none of it even matters i actually want to lose weight till i look sick i want someone to notice that i am not doing okay every comment i make about how i do not feel like eating people have actually said wow you are so lucky that is soo good i do not want to lose weight to fit into my clothes or get compliments i know this is not a new take i have had an ed for the past 10 years but my goal was always to lose weight and look good which usually caused me to have imposter syndrome with my ed because of how i could switch it on and off like that usually someone would make a comment about how fat i am and i would lose it and trigger my ed again this time i genuinely could not care less about how i look i probably will not be satisfied till i look in the mirror and do not recognize what i see,1,262
boycotting against major grocery store chain that has all my safe foods ok before i start this is about a canadian grocery store chain that has a monopoly over groceries in canada they are currently partaking in price gouging in a time where canadians are struggling with cost of living as much as i want to fully support the month long boycott i already get so overwhelmed by going grocery shopping i had to visit 4 different stores to get most of my safe foods which is inconvenient as i do not have a car transit takes the same amount of time as walking certain foods that i like yogurt frozen waffles tea juice are made by the grocery store brand and i have not found a substitute that i like yet i do not have the money to try a bunch of new things either it feels silly that this grocery store boycott will make me want to restrict but i hate change and i do not want to support a company that is contributing to our cost of living issues i can support local for fruits veg meat and some pantry items but most of what i eat can only be found at this grocery store also weirdly enough they have the best selection of dairy free ice cream and i never realized how limited my options are outside of this store,1,234
scared to ask for help i want to ask for help i am scared of this ed i do not want this but i just cannot get out of it i want to reach out to absolutely anyone but i know eventually it will reach my parents and i do not want them to know especially my mother because i am scared of their reactions my mother once saw a simple powerpoint i made on all the different eating disorders wokr me up and started yelling at me angerlily asking if i was anorexic so now i just do not feel safe enough to come to her with this or anyone out of fear they will tell her she tells at me a lot for all types of mental illnesses i just hate this situation i am in even when i try to eat more i just i cannot it is tiring,1,152
does anyone else think about plates portions and the composition of meals all the time i am constantly thinking about and anxious about the size of plates the shape of them wether to use a plate or bowl how to plate the food wether to use one plate or multiple it is exhausting plus food portions drive me insane i am so anxious if the food looks like too much to the point where salads are now making me anxious because even like 50 grams of leaves fill up a bowl but also a small portion is scary because i am afraid i will feel hungry after it and then i will have to make another meal and do this mental gymnastics again if i use one big plate it makes me anxious because it is a big plate if i put the food in separate smaller plates makes me anxious because it is multiple plates while i prepare the food i constantly switch around the food and the plates and i am thinking about all that while i am thinking about calories total grams of food my stomach is fucked up if i eat too much volume i feel awful macros because i do not track those but they still make me anxious the order in which to eat the food the number of meals in a day because multiple small meals i freak out fewer bigger meals i freak out i feel like i am going genuinely insane i do not know how a normal plate and portion looks and i am thinking about it and worrying about the visual look of my meals 24 7 i am hoping it is because if how little my intake is once i get help and start a normal meal plan my brain will at least partly be less crazy bit i am genuinely so tired,1,315
avoiding extreme hunger i need to not lose any more weight but what is holding me back from even slightly raising my intake is the fact that the last time i did which was in an admittedly seriously traumatizing ip experience that quite literally permanently ruined my entire trust in any doctor i got eh it was insane and took months of extreme low res to overcome has anyone found any possible tactics to avoid it aside from that advice fans of all in give when they claim that you just have to keep stuffing your face with whatever you want 24 7 just hoping there is any way to avoid it other than going back to low res to kill my hunger cues which obviously defeats the point of any sort of attempt to maintain,1,136
substances does anyone else find it impossible to deal with an ed as well as substance abuse issues it is like switching from one addiction to another one is an easy distraction from the other i love it because it takes my mind off things but at the same time i feel very lost,1,54
i strive to be a child again i never had the chance to fully become a kid i was forced to mature early i feel like starving myself will make me turn back the clock somehow and feel worthy of being protected i am going back to childish fashion behaviors and other things and hope that it will make me feel happy again i do not deserve protection unless i am weak vulnerable and small i am 16 i am supposed to act my age but i do not want to,1,91
accepting myself finally this last week i did so well with eating i joined in on food with friends during school fast foods and my body did not drastically change i remained the same size looks wise i do not weigh myself anymore and i have gotten closer with the boy i like i am happy i chose recovery this year my grades are improving and i feel like i do not mind myself anymore obviously i do not think i love myself or will ever love myself but i accept myself finally after 5 long years of disorder i am getting happier i can spontaneously join in on food trips during lunch at school and i can eat crisps without feeling bad this is all because i am in a new friend group and it is improved my outlook on life so much catalysed by going out for a friend s birthday where i wore a revealing outfit for the first time i receive so many compliments on my looks and outfits now just wanted to get this out there laugh,1,182
google fit logging steps and connect to myfitnesspal so yesterday i downloaded loseit and google fit but am still using myfitnesspal for now i was wondering if google fit can be connected also is it reliable in logging steps so i can export them to mfp or does it log total expenditure i just want to be sure before i delete my old step tracker application tysm,1,67
i tackled a fear food today and i enjoyed it and i am okay and nothing bad happened most people in my life do not know about my ed so i do not have many places to celebrate   so i here am celebrating here i am proud of myself for being brave and for allowing myself to accept some joy through food hopefully this inspires someone else to celebrate their small wins whatever they may be lt 3,1,78
does what i ate today actually affect the scale tomorrow if i ate a bunch of bread and carbs today and my maintenance calories do you think that could because me to weigh like 5 10 pounds more,1,38
i feel so guilty okay so i am not a fan of chocolate but today i just felt like i want some and i ate like one tablespoon now i feel like i am going to cry because in the past month i stopped throwing up and i tried to focus on controlling my meals and just eating whatever i want i indeed lost like 3 kilos which i did not even realise because i stopped checking it so i am sooo close to recovery but this fucking feeling i get whenever i eat something that has a lot of calories just hunts me i noticed that life is just so much fun when i act normal to this day i still label food bad or good in my mind i do not think ill ever get over that i have been doing that since i was so young i cannot get rid of the mindset anyone feeling the same,1,160
my brain really wants me to take my loved one s seizure medication side effects include appetite suppressant weight loss anorexia i am really spiraling right now because of other thing going on in my life being a caregiver to this person and a new possible romantic interest my weird rules about dating tell me i cannot pursue this until i lose x amount of weight i am undeserving undesirable and it will not be sustainable at this weight my very close loved one had a terrible change in health last year and is on anti seizure meds they were recently switched to a new medication and they were reading out all of the side effects to me after looking it up myself even posts on reddit say doctors have been prescribing this to people for weight loss obviously i would never in my darkest hour steal potentially life saving medication from anyone but it does not stop my brain from obsessing about it i can not stop thinking about the meds sitting 5 featuring away from me in the cabinet i hate this feeling posting here to get it off my chest and hopefully release these thoughts from my mind thankful for this space x,1,206
stressing about eggs eggs have been a staple food for me for years i go through phases where i get egg ick but one of my ultimate safe foods is a piece of toast with a soft boiled egg and lots of salt if i am visiting my parents i can make myself an egg for lunch when they might not have other foods i feel comfortable eating they are cheap have decent protein are a reliable number of calories and keep me full but the avian flu situation has made me so scared of eggs i know the cdc says they are safe to eat if fully cooked but i do not trust it lol would a carton of pasteurized egg whites be safer or does anyone have any good protein equivalents instead of eggs i eat cottage cheese yogurt tofu but it is harder to keep track of the kcal without measuring and i do not always have a scale,1,162
anybody that had their first major relapse in their mid 20s what was your experience like what was it like to have a major relapse in your mid 20s or after i have had a pretty intense ed from 13 on and officially tried recovering for the first time at 18 19ish i was really sure i had fully recovered somehow until i realized it just morphed into pretty intense bulimia it did not click that different recovered around 21 22 i think i actually got to a point where i was semi recovered it was still always in the back of my mind but my life was not centered around it and for a while i thought there is no way it would get bad again because i learned my lesson now i am 23 and i think i am at the early stages of a major relapse i think i have accidentally crossed the line of no return and when i look back to the past year year and a half i can see it was a long time coming and maybe i never actually recovered i have no idea what to expect though it feels so different now at 23 than it did at 13 or 16 or 19 i cannot wrap my mind around it all happening again what was your experience with relapsing in adulthood like,1,231
my sister and mom might know in some way i am 14 by the way so do not say i can direct message you because i will not firstly my mom and sister both are overweight bigger so keep that in mind it started in december when i would go on tumblr and see ed posts it really made me stop and think about how i am not like most girls my age i have lots of acne at that time this is what i was thinking by the way i do not do sports i do not go to public school i do not do my own hair i do not have some kind of lover or crush that actually exists etc it made me feel bad and i decided to weigh myself   found out that i was like  10 15lb overweight for my age and height seeing that just made me feel so bad maybe it was because i was not as active as i could have been i do not know but it made me want to stop eating so much i began eating only breakfast and dinner 11am 5pm and exercising i lost about 5lb within 2 5 days it made me just want to keep going then in january i started restricting like a lot  and over exercising in february was the same but then i started binging it made me feel so bad i did not understand why i was eating when i was not hungry eating when i am already full yet i just kept doing it my stomach would hurt so much and i would just keep eating so i started walking it off for hours outside along with running i mean hours like 3 6 hours outside just walking along this path back and fourth they would literally beg for me to come back in and i would get so mad i would say stuff like i am not hungry or make stuff up and really sell it by saying i do not feel good for dayyysss until the day i planned to not eat a thing besides lunch comes around and i would sleep and exercise all day because i am sick and i do not feel good of course i am not eating i lost weight but not enough for it to be noticeable to anyone besides me in february i also started purging but march and april is when i started restricting purging and binging sometimes in the same day i would even lie and say i do not feel good just so i could go outside to walk and purge up my food and they would just think that i am walking outside to feel better it is getting worse and i hate trying to hide it my mom is also trying to loose weight she does not know about me losing weight or what i have been going through neither does my sister but here is why i think they know something especially now but one time at a restaurant after eating i said i have to use the restroom my mom looked at me weird  as if she knew what i was going to go do this was in march by the way i went in there to purge and i did not know she even came in there because i did not see her following me while i was on my way to the restroom i also had a planner that my mom got me that i started writing in during january i basically would write down how many meals how many snacks how much exercise i did how much i weighed etc every single day my sister would comment on how cute it is that i would do that and she would wonder what i write in it she was 19 she is 20 now though i do not know if she looked in it or not but a few times of her talking about how me writing in my planner is cute her and my mom would make breakfast and my mom say stuff like i am glad to see you eating and my mom would look at me and i swear to you  it looked like she knew like i said i do not know if it was a combination of me walking outside a lot plus me saying no to food and my planner but it was kind of really scary it really liked like she could see the truth but if my sister suspected something why would she be saying stuff like why are you drinking all of my hot chocolate that is mine who said you could have that greedy little child that is my food why are you eating my food she is joking by the way she is literally just joking but i ask her to stop and i tell her how it is not even funny and she does not understand what she is doing wrong and i hate that and this was literally an hour ago just now also literally like 12 minutes ago i made 2 vent posts on an application we both have big mistake i have done it before and never got caught but what caught her attention is me putting a trigger warning about food and eating plus i said in the title that it was about my sister i deleted both posts so she did not see what they were but she saw the titles which says enough i have made posts on reddit as well about my ed which kind of makes me nervous i do not mind my online friends knowing but posting on reddit kind of scares me for whatever reason and most of all my family knowing scares me i do not want them knowing but somebody on reddit told me that i should seek help since i am still young but i cannot i do not want to even if i did tell my family or was just a little more open about it it is not like my mom can afford therapy for me or doctors she could but could not at the same time i would rather just die from this rather than have my family know to be honest it is so embarrassing i cannot even hide it as well as before i have just gotten so comfortable with being this way it scares me to give back to how i used to be i barely even remember how i used to be last year before i started all i can think about is weight loss and food it is all i have been thinking about since december and it is just been getting easier and easier for me to restrict and i keep finding new ways to hide stuff from them,1,1151
has anyone admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward for their ed was it a positive experience how did you go about the process i am considering it because i have been told i need to do inpatient care in order to step down to residential treatment which i really want i have no si or self harm historically or currently i just have a restrictive ed and i do not know what to do,1,74
had to go to the hospital last night they diagnosed me with gastroparesis this is the first real intense complication that is came from my ed my fiance took me in so i was too embarrassed to say i have anorexia but once i heard her say that i knew exactly what was going on i am so sad and my stomach still hurts horribly,1,65
i hate how i look now that i am in a binging phase last august october i started to restrict again after a few months of regular eating mixed in with binging i stopped the heavy restricting and now i am back in a regular eating binge phase and it is driving me insane i have gained some weight over the course of the last half a year which did not bother me until about a couple weeks ago i do not even think about it until i take a selfie or look in the mirror i just feel so ugly my face looks bloated and chubby again i have gained weight around my stomach and my double chin is much more prominent again i have not felt so ugly since before my restricting phase started last august i genuinely cannot look at my face or body without being disgusted but i just cannot help it i know i am probably going to end up restricting again at some point which i really do not want to do but i also really do not want to binge anymore either i cannot count calories to maintain a healthy diet or else i will relapse into restricting but if i do not manage my calories and portion sizes i will just keep binging i am so sick of this cycle it is been like this since i was 12 and i am 20 now i really want to get help but i am also terrified to gain more weight if i seek professional guidance i am already in the higher normal range for bmi i just do not know what to do anymore,1,281
my mom literally laughed at me i bought a scale and my mom saw it and laughed at me i have been struggling for a long time now but damn then she just looked at me and said hunny if you want to lose weight i can help you and then laughed more i want to die,1,57
had a seizure last night i am epileptic but i grew out of it for the most part and went over a year seizure free i have been heavily restricting lately and i think that is why i had the seizure it lasted over an hour and i was conscious for it not a grand mal  it was so scary but it did not deter me to recover at all if anything my brain liked the attention i am so stupid,1,81
tripping right now and finally seeing things god i sound like every teen smoking weed for the first time but i am currently trippin right now and i can see myself i can see how tired i look but i am pretty i am not this hideous monster i have convinced myself of it is not the end of the world i ate more last night i finally feel like everything will be okay sorry this is just a shit post i am just happy,1,85
i do this thing where i will only allow myself to eat if i like what i see on the scale if i do not like what i see i will keep restricting until i do because i have safe weights where i feel ok at if i see that i have lost weight ill allow myself to eat anybody else do this or something similar lmao,1,67
my body is the only thing i can control i cannot stop everything bad from occurring it is solely me and my body and i get happiness from restricting,1,29

my life with an ed i do not know what i have but this is what i go through every day i wake up and walk 7 miles on the treadmill takes me 2 hours then i lift weights for 10 minutes then i shower and eat breakfast then get ready for work usually or just get ready for the day it takes me 5 hours from when i wake up before i can ever leave the house i spend a lot of money on protein bars or health snacks some days i stick to low calories other days i go totally off the rails binge and restrict pattern on my days off i walk another 3 miles in the evening to get all my steps and hit my burn so on my days off i am limited to only doing things during the middle of the day in the morning i try to poop as much as possible and do not allow myself to eat or drink anything until i have weighed myself after my 2 3 hours of workouts to make sure i get the lowest number possible i am scared of using lotion on my body because i am afraid it will add more weight to me i drink a gallon of water on days i work and chew 2 3 packs of gum a day to avoid eating so much i am underweight i will have a meal or two a week with family or friends but plan for it heavily with restricting before and after the meal day is planned eating disorders are hell,1,269
less common ed consequence i am just going to say it rectal prolapse yup i feel like this could be an unsurprisingly common consequence of ed s considering one of the causes is frequent excessive straining amp another also possibly being laxative abûse yet i rarely see it being spoken about it would be cool to hear others opinion s amp if anyone else has any experience of this but yeah noticed it a couple months ago tried to ignore it think it is gotten worse booking a doctors appointment on monday i am scared be careful listen to your body do not ignore when something feels off,1,108
i remember when i was like 10 i asked my babysitter if you eat half of a cracker and then you keep eating half of the other half will it ever go away they should have known then smh,1,39

portions of food whenever i let myself eat smth i cannot help obsessing over if people would consider it a normal portion cuz i know damn well it is not disordered portion and i am letting myself go i just want to know at least that i am not a pig i just sometimes wish i could tell somebody what i ate so they can tell me if it was too much or too little or just ok i do not know i have no idea what is considered a good amount anymore,1,93

parents will not just shut up i get they do not know about my ed or ed s in general but they will not stop insulting the way i look when i was growing during puberty they will not stop making fun of how large i was getting and now that i am too skinny they will not stop telling me i look diseased or i look like a skeleton i get it comes from a place of concern but i really cannot take it anymore why are they like this every single day every single time they see me they just cannot help but comment on how gross i look i understand they are worried about me but i wish they would stop i have already told them it hurts me but they think it is funny,1,138

if anyone wants to feel better about being paranoid i saw multiple posts on this sub today about people being paranoid about drinks not being sugar free or restaurant fast food workers not giving us the right drinks diet sugar free thing we ordered so i am sharing how crazy i am basically i live in a dorm and i have shitty roommate situation atm but luckily next year i will have better roommates and so i have been buying overpriced iced lattes from my school s coffee shop because i have a ton of dining money i need to use up my financial aid scholarhsips cover the cost   and if i do not use up the money my family gets fined us colleges basically i found out which brand of almond milk they use saw how much they use for the size drink i get i have watched the baristas enough times to see that they actually weight out everything so i technically know how many calories are in my drink each and every time i also always order it without sugar syrup every time however i am always so paranoid that they add sugar use the wrong milk and i always stare down the baristas and then as soon as i get my drink i tap the tip of one of my fingers on top just to double check that its right,1,234
how to make refeeding hurt less you know what is so annoying i ate food that i really wanted to eat today granted it was the first meal i ate and it was dinner but i was excited and wanting to eat it i got hibachi because i had a hankering and i always get to a dilemma do i continue to eat even though i feel kind of full or do i stop eating as soon as i feel even the slightest bit of discomfort i am restrictive and i cannot purge so binging is not something i usually do but now i feel so sick but i think a healthy person would just call this full how can i eleviate this feeling i chew mint gum and that is all i have got i have to take a shower later and i should have thought about that before i ate all this food but damn it was so good and i love it,1,165
trouble making meals does anyone else have trouble cooking my boyfriend does all the cooking and i either just eat what he makes or i eat prepackaged meals snacks vegetables fruits all day i am not sure exactly what it is but the best way i can describe it is that i feel like i do not deserve to make an effort to make food for myself i feel almost guilty having to buy all of the ingredients at the store i feel like i am not worth the hassle i do not know maybe someone feels the same and can expand on their feelings and help me understand myself better,1,111
hobbies that have the same obsessive elements of eds i love the obsessive thinking of having an ed meticulously planning my meals counting cals obsessively weighing myself doing research into exercise routines feeling the pleasurable pain of moving my body and whipping myself into doing more etc but i know i have to stop are there any hobbies that require the same type of thinking that i can replace orthorexia with lol i tried getting into making model airplanes as an obsess over small details thing but it just does not hit the same,1,94
relapsing again and i want to blame my doctor i have been struggling with relapse and the return of ed thoughts for a few weeks after being in recovery for about 10 months i had a gp appointment last week to check in and she asked if it was okay if we got a weight i said yes but i cannot see it she said okay that is fine so i step on the scale and she says oh x kilograms that is good oh my god so i spiralled managed to hold everything together in the rest of the appointment but got in my car and cried for so long i would already had a super rough morning at work and that just absolutely ruined me and now that little ed voice is not so little anymore and the self loathing self deprecating thoughts are back and so vicious i am so angry at her for triggering me so badly,1,161
insta recovery community i do not know if it is just me but i find the insta recovery people more triggering than like anything its just the fact that i can tell i am currently smaller than them but still not as small as they were that sends me over the edge like they did it better than me and i do not deserve to recover till i get get as small as they did,1,75
why cannot i accept that i have an ed i have had issues with food for as long as i can remember i remember watching a movie at only 10 where someone gt  cut out carbs  lt and thinking i needed to do the same and then tried to lol i would also binge eat constantly to soothe myself during a traumatic childhood then i would gt  starve  lt myself i remember being in the 7th grade 13 and frequenting pr0 ana forums i would literally take gt  freezing ice cold baths and basically torture myself because the forums said it would help lose lmfao i would also exercise constantly and all of this other shit   lt it progressed to gt  purging  lt i was sent to a couple of psych wards for suicide attempts at 14 and 15 amp they knew about it and i was forced to be watched after every single time i ate i also was never allowed to be in the bathroom by myself which makes me extremely uncomfortable to remember all the times gt  adult staff  lt would barge in on me while i was showering and shit ugh it is been a cycle doing one or the other up until a couple of years ago where i developed reactive hypoglycemia oh yeah and i forgot to mention the orthorexia of course i would literally cry in the grocery store or feel so frustrated and want to just walk out and currently i let food that i think is scary for obvious reasons rot i let it sit in the back of the shelf until it expires i am also extremely nervous about baking i just bought a cookbook and was so excited then i realized how many scary ingredients go into baked goods i am okay with buying a pastry at a bakery and i know they use that much gt  butter sugar etc  lt so why i cannot i just relax and actually give it a go oh gosh and let us not forget my wanting a child someday but being horrified to even do so sometimes i will shower in the dark to avoid looking at my current body there is no way i would ever be able to handle pregnancy i would be gt  suicidal every second most likely   lt and despite all of this i do not consider myself disordered why i do not think i have a normal relationship with food but then again who does,1,418

uh ohhhhh hey i have been in and out of recovery for almost a year but i have gained a lot of weight from a pituitary gland tumor and recently i have gotten sick and lost my appetite i know this is going to because a full blow relapse because i like the way to feels to be empty i know i should just accept the weight is out of my control right now but everyone has been making comments on it like 40 pounds in a year is crazy and i cannot stop thinking about how nice it feels to have an empty stomach i can tell i look a little different from not eating and i love it i want to keep going if i hate my body and everyone else does then what is stopping me,1,139
relapsed i just realised that i will never be able to fully recover from my ed and it sucks i have been doing really well in terms of eating what i want and taking care of my body but old habits break hard thoughts from my worst state of mind linger like a pest feeding off insecurities that i thought i had already gotten over i do not know what if anything caused my relapse this time and it is come back stronger than before my intense desire to appear thinner weighs heavy on my back but i cannot afford to put my mind and body through this again i am exhausted of the mental torment my ed puts me through and it is incredibly frustrating since i was initially in the best mental state i have been in a long while of course i am trying my hardest to focus on recovery but the thoughts never leave,1,158
how many food scales do you own granted i am autistic but i am up to eight if i include the ones at work just so i can always measure with ease and speed without much fuss amp nbsp amp nbsp bonus which scale do you use i cannot stop myself,1,51
i need motivation to recover hi i am currently 16 and i am suffering from anorexia b p subtype i mainly purge through fasting never through thr0wing up i know all there is to know about the long term health effects that this horrible disorder can have on you but embarrassingly enough i cannot imagine recovery my ed affects my life in many ways i have the dream to become a doctor surgeon one day ironic but most days i cannot even focus or remember anything and i am only a junior in high school i get chest pains every now and then i have lanugo and my fingers turn blue sometimes i have been going through disordered eating since i was 12 and this is my longest relapse i feel like i cannot stop because this is the most i have ever lost and i cannot give up the control either because i feel like it is never enough a part of me feels like i will get to my gw and stop but i know logically that if i cannot stop now and i am only four months in what will make me stop when it is been even longer this is all to say is there any support that anyone can give me to get better or any personal stories to possibly fear monger me anything is appreciated thank you,1,233
boyfriend said i gained weight i am an anorexic who is severely self conscious i actually lost weight since i have seen him i am going to spiral i know he had good intentions because he wants me to get better and thinks i am getting better when i am not my god my day was so ruined,1,58
advice regarding younger siblings i have two younger siblings and i have noticed that my sister who is a little younger than me has been doing things that i recognize to be part of my daily behaviors i e swapping out foods not eating much despite being hungry lower calorie snacks and i am just worried it is not like an everyday thing but she will replace higher calorie foods with others at meals every so often or just not eat some of them and i know she is a huge perfectionist and   yeah lots of things i could be projecting but she is really really active so i do not want something bad to happen to her should she start restricting i think i may bring it up with my parents but i do not know what to do i just do not want her to follow in my footsteps i care a lot about her even though we do not get along well and i am really scared that i may have started something i am also scared that if she does restrict more it will trigger me but that is really another issue if there are any older siblings or younger siblings or literally anybody with insight i would really appreciate it,1,215
triggered by family my mom has known about my ed for all the years i have had it as time went on i let her know which comments she made triggered me she seems to acknowledge it only to make the same comment a few weeks later always telling me what and how much she ate commenting on other ppls bodies saying things about herself telling me if she lost or gained she even sometimes jokes about how healthy i eat which i do not know how she does not see that as a problem for me ik she does not mean any harm but i just wish she would actually take the steps to watch what she says instead of pretending to hear me it is been so long that now i have given up on even asking her to stop idek if she realizes that it bothers me still,1,151
i cannot do the whole eating and weight thing anymore tw weight and cal mentions i have been continuously gaining weight been in recovery for 2 years and only recently i gained 20 more pounds since december from growth despite eating way less than i should be and definitely not enough to be growing i am so sick of it food makes me guilty all the time but i cannot stop eating and eating i am not even binge eating i am just sad after eating and no matter what i do i cannot lose the weight i have not gotten fat but my bones have increased and so have my breasts so i do not fit clothes i used to anymore and i am just so over it i do not even want to eat anymore but then i get uncontrollably hungry i do not even know how i am gaining weight or muscle from less than 1000 calories its depressing that i cannot even do anorexia recovery or anything right i am the same weight as my super skinny friend who is 6 1 i am 5 6 everyone else is skinny and losing weight why am i so different edit spelling,1,204
movies about ed only have skinny actresses i know that sounds like super obvious because it is i am not pointing out something new but it just frustrates me that most always the ed is anorexia and it is always a skinny and conventionally beautiful actress ed can and does affect thin and beautiful people as well but if you were to only take movies and t v it seems like those are the only people allowed to have them if it is a bigger person or a non conventionally attractive person it is a joke so it says they should feel bad if you think you are worthless because you are fat and ugly you only deserve help and understanding if you are actually thin and beautiful but just do not know it it just makes it hard for me to suspend my belief when watching it this angel faced waif not so skinny she is not still red carpet hot theough is crying about looking like a hedious monster when this is a person who obviously been told they are beautiful their whole life and has never been more than a size 2 there are plenty of actors take some risk cast someone who is above a size four and who does not have a face made for a perfume commercial,1,223
accepting the fact i am ill i am not intending to glamorize anything but i am unsure how to truly accept the fact i have an eating disorder i have had an eating disorder for two years now and still i feel as though it is just an aspect of myself that is a bit odd and not a debilitating illness i have autism and the repetitive habits the structure everything about my ed appeals to the part of my brain that craves these things it is like it is the only thing that makes me feel grounded sometimes the only thing that allows me to feel productive and like a human with responsibilities i know i have an eating disorder but i just cannot fully accept how serious it is and the long term impacts that i have already made myself hyper aware of i feel like i will feel this way until it is just too late,1,159
the way non disordered people deem someone skinny is so different than how i disordered person would call someone skinny i was with my guy friend and i ordered a vodka soda and he was like are you sticking to vodka sodas all night got to keep your skinny figure like obviously playful not weird or anything it is just interesting what other people define skinny as for reference i am a normal bmi,1,74
anyone else deal with side effects from a lot of walking so i have developed an exercise addiction where i walk at least 20k steps a day and i am struggling my feet hurt constantly yes i wear shoes and my hamstring tendons are sore and just feel horrible also my back is killing me it is kind of getting unbearable does anyone have any tips to avoid these effects i also feel like i want to faint constantly when walking around my house because i only have one meal a day and i just want to walk without having these issues i am currently underweight and i restrict heavily omad at night which probably does not help matters in terms of walking i would choose a different exercise but walking is the only thing my tired body can handle,1,140
after purging brain fog anybody else get really bad brain fog after purging like you cannot think or function any way to prevent i am at work and i purged and now i am struggling to talk my eyes are barely even focusing,1,43
i am worried about my boyfriend tw possible relapse no numbers but mentions of size of meals both my boyfriend and i had eds in high school his was more severe than mine since i have moved in with him i have noticed that he barely eats anything during breakfast or lunch and then he eats a bit more at dinner but not nearly enough for the fact he has not eaten all day i am worried about him and i do not know how to help him recover in the ways he is helped me any advice or tips,1,100
what would be your first food in recovery if you were to start recovery today if you are not already in it what would your ideal first food meal be i would go with a fried pb amp j edit you guys are making me hungry all your foods sound amazing haha,1,52
to the child with dad i rang up who put back an item because your dad said he would only buy it if you ate dinner first i hope i am wrong about why you refused your dad s offer but that pleading in your dad s voice the way you hugged him to make him stop asking made me worry for you if my fears are right it is not too late to turn back from this you looked to be the same age i was when i started maybe a little younger i went through the same thing with my own family and they eventually lost all trust in me if you cannot stop for any other reason stop because your dad will eventually go from begging you to making you with consequences for refusing do not lose the last few years of your childhood to this do not lose your bone density your brain function your health your peace of mind none of it is worth sacrificing some of it will never come back why do you think i am a cashier instead of having a degree in chemistry like i planned because i starved myself stupid please do what i could not   what i did not   and get out as soon as you can you have time even if you feel like you are at rock bottom as long as your heart is still beating you can climb out signed the cashier who pretended she did not hear what was going on in front of her,1,260
i feel so worthless because i switched from running to biking i tried relapsing anorexia and running but that was almost impossible i could only run a little over a mile and i knew i could not keep going so i got a bike and used that however i stopped restricting and continued my recovery but i did not start running again because i felt lazy and when you stop running for a while it is hard to get back into it for me at least i also hated running in revealing sportswear so much the running clothes i have were from when i was smaller and thinner i do not want to ask my parents to buy me clothes because i bought so many expensive outside and exercise clothes while i had an ed i feel like my mom will express disappointment in me if i ask for bigger clothes like how she did when i confessed that i had anorexia but i just hate how i feel so fat and slow when i run and now i feel so worthless just riding my bike it burns fewer calories and now my legs are starting to feel less toned i do not know if it is just my body dysmorphia but it just makes me feel like a failure and so lazy i know the fact that i am exercising at all is good but it is just so complicated in my head i want to run again but i gained more weight since i biked and i am so scared to just start because i hate being slow at the beginning i know everyone needs to improve but why am i stuck this morning my mom made pancakes and i was going to eat some but i decided not to because i do not run and only bike i have so many lapses like one every week but i never follow through and just end up binging at the end i have been recovered for 2 months but i am going mentally insane about everything after i overshot amp  x200b,1,352
really stressed about not being able to exercise i have really done it now i broke my foot playing with my dog somehow i do not even know how it happened i was running then my ankle rolled and i broke my foot me and my mom were both convinced that a broken foot would hurt worse so we waited for 10 days before going to the dr during that time i went to an event at my college to prepare for my first year this fall walking around on it so much that i was in tears at the end of it i went to a job interview that included job shadowing and was on my feet for about 45 minutes walked around on it at home constantly well i went yesterday morning and they told me i broke my fifth metatarsal and i will have to go to an orthopedic surgeon on monday to determine if i need surgery or not i made it a lot worse by not going to the dr and walking around on it all over i have a boot now and i am supposed to not put any weight on it as much as possible i am so stressed about not being able to walk exercise obviously you can do things without your feet but they do not burn very many calories i am stressed like a lot ugh i weighed myself today and i have gained a pound over the last week not exercising like i should be and before you say it is ok gaining a few pounds will not kill you i weigh gt  200 pounds and have a bmi of 33  lt right now do not shame me it is a really fucking long story but i just wanted to say that so you can understand why it is not ok that i gain back the weight that i have already lost,1,323
fucking tired of everything 14 with anorexia and an exercise addiction what a great combo i do not enjoy exercise anymore i used to like running until it turned into something i used purely for burning calories same thing with dancing i am running off of caffeine because i overconsume that too due to lack of energy i have never been this fucking low i have gone from almost obese to a bmi of gt  17 7  lt in a year i am fucking exhausted i cannot even sleep at night because i force myself to stay up and burn off some calories for the next day i keep myself in a gt  900 1000  lt calorie deficit every day but for whatever reason do not even lose those gt  2 pounds a week  lt and i have not eaten even just my bmr since last july everybody thinks i am way too skinny i am constantly bloated for whatever fucking reason and i never wear anything fashionable anymore only sweatpants pajama pants leggings and hoodies and they all have to be so oversized except leggings or workout shorts because that would be so ugly or i will not wear them i cannot figure out if i want to just continue this or die my period has been gone since july 2023 and my bloodwork is horrendous my kidney and liver function is off my electrolytes are off and i am just not healthy my bones hurt so bad all of the time but i still barely ever sit and just chill out i have my designated time at night but then its back to exercising at 12am so i can keep my move rings up i skip everything to go to the gym burn calories in general i want to be in a smaller more sustainable deficit but i am too scared i know i will not tell anybody what is really going on and that i am just going to have to wait until somebody finally figures it out and i get forced into recovery which ill just refuse anyways i hate my life all i want is someone to tell me everything will be okay and it will all work out in the end and maybe to let me get a few of my hobbies back because moving all the time is boring and i need something to focus on besides how shitty my body feels,1,409
does anyone else need to eat in neat numbers by that i mean that if my lunch is gt  220 cals  lt i need to add gt  30 cals  lt to make it gt  250  lt because i cannot stand the number not being perfect lol,1,46
i hate myself this is an unnecessarily long rant of nothing today i baked a shokupan loaf for my boyfriend and told him to pick it up on his way home from class he wanted to bring something for me in return but i told him not to because i do not want anything but in the end he showed up with a cup of falooda in front of my house that is a dessert my sweet tooth has been craving for days and i have casually told him that i want falooda a couple times these days too the ice cream in that cup of falooda he brought looked so good but i could not have it i would not let myself have it and me a dumb fucking bitch made it so obvious that i am upset with him bringing falooda for me he looked really sad when i greeted him good bye at the door obviously because i told him that i am not eating it and gave it to my mom in front of him he does not know about my ed he went out of his way and kindly bought something i have been craving for days really he is the sweetest ever and i was supposed to be happy like everyone else would have been at that moment why could not i just be grateful or why could not i just act like i was happy for a short moment i hate myself so much for making him feel that he is at fault for such kind and sweet action now i have not eaten all day i could have just omad that falooda thinking about it now i cannot bring myself to reply to his texts because i feel like an awful person and a terrible gf to him i even cannot eat the meal i originally planned for today anymore literally why cannot i just be normal,1,325
can someone tell me the workers are not my enemy i have literally worked food service ik i am being stupid but can someone tell me fast food workers are not my enemies and lie if they gave me sugar free i ordered and then called to make sure it was sugar free and they said yes but oh my god,1,61
trust issues does anyone else have this issue with not trusting the numbers you see when you are weighing food and stuff like it feels more safe to eat things that are already weighed and in a bag or something with a nutrition label just me,1,46
nutritionist wants me to gain and asking me to stop using weights and exercise i 18m recently was advised to get a nutritionist for my weight gain currently i am gt  56kg  lt and 186cm 6ft 1 the nutritionist wants me to stop doing exercises for the time being as its deemed not safe for me at the moment and i need to focus on re energises myself i quite like working out and i feel sort of crap on days i do not is the nutritionist in the right and should i take a break from exercise till mid june when i have gone up about gt  2kg   lt,1,110
was a good little recovery girl and ate a normal amount of food now lying in bed hating myself and trying not to plan to compensate tomorrow fuck this fuck this hellish disorder,1,33
does anyone else do this stupid thing i do not know y i do this to myself does anyone else walk to fast food places and just stare at the menu and then walk back home without ordering anything i have done this twice today with 2 different places i even bring my wallet and make an order in my mind what i would not give to b able to walk to sonic and order a burger without feeling so disgusting funny thing is i am probably going to walk back later and order something knowing me,1,97
why is restricting so hard now as a kid i could fast for insane amounts and be fine now i skip a couple meals and walk a lot and i am unable to properly work at my job calorie deficits do not even feel real anymore bmr plus the calories burned from walking wasteful amounts and the number on the scale tomorrow will still be higher than today because my intake is too high for my metabolism yet too low for the online calculators it is never even water weight i will gain and maintain for a long time then gain more maybe this is my sin for not lifting,1,110
projecting onto my roommate i never really understood the science behind psychological projection but now i am experiencing it firsthand my roommate is a healthy individual and she eats a whole lot of food and snacks constantly throughout the day and i mean constantly snacking nonstop i often stay out in the library because it bothers me so much just the chewing sound and smell and everything especially because it makes me irritated because i know inside i am not letting myself eat like that and i constantly judge her internally like these days she is been saying she is going on a diet but non disordered people are so oblivious to caloric intake she does not eat the bread roll from her soup and salad combo meal but snacks on a whole container of carrots with peanut butter i always resist the urge to tell her she is not going to lose any weight because of calories and such and i have to catch myself from just losing my shit and telling her to stop eating all the time or that her constant eating bothers me so much but on the other hand i know it is just my ed projecting myself onto her just wanting to restrict and starve all the time i sometimes wonder if she actually has bed because one day there was a wing stop delivery outside our dorm room beside the door and i guess no one picked it up for a while but honestly it has not even been two full days until she told me she took the package and ate it i do not think it is normal to just eat someone is order because no one picked it up we live with two other suitemates it could have been theirs,1,300
recovery videos make me have breakdowns do not get me wrong here seeing people recover is great i am the biggest pro recovery advocate ever it just is very triggering when people post before photos there is a tiktok where a girl posted her body check 3 months apart after going into recovery and when i tell you i was sobbing on the floor for an hour i know this makes me sound very selfish and i am not saying people cannot post before and after recovery pics but it just made me not want to recover more when i see people s body before recovering from anorexia it always feels like they are thinner than me i see their body and realize that they are underweight and i am not it makes me feel like i do not deserve recovery or that i do not deserve to eat because my disorder was never as bad as theirs it only makes me want to restrict harder in hopes that one day people will congratulate me for getting better instead of just seeing me as a healthy person pigging out everytime they get close to food i hate this disorder and anyone who has recovered is so strong because this is so hard to keep living with i feel like all these years i have struggled and cried over my weight and food but i still have nothing to show for it i am not sure if this made sense but if you feel the same or similar to me i am so sorry i am wishing for both you and to find the mindset to get out of this one day,1,281
it is getting bad again i got caught purging so many times that i finally cut down on it i was only doing it 1 3 times a week for a bit but i gained weight and now it is back to every day and if i am honest i am hoping it kills me i keep hoping my esophagus will burst and i will bleed out over the toilet or that my constant stomach pain turns out to be something serious enough to be a death sentence i can feel this becoming dangerous it is getting easier to hide not harder i can do it pretty much silently now it is too easy too quick why would not i get rid of my food when it is so easy the only reason i am not purging everything i eat is because i have to wait until everyone goes to bed and i do not have the self control to fast until evening today i slept through a job interview i wanted to blame my family for not trying to wake me up but the truth is even if they did i probably would not have gone i do not want to do anything but die there is puke on my bedsheets i cannot be bothered to clean up there is a bin covered in vomit in my closet probably molding i have not done laundry in weeks i feel like i am finally reaching the end of my rope i have been suicidal for 7 years attempted a handful of times i just wish my habits would kill me so i can pretend it is not my fault,1,279
my neck hurts so bad after purging i did it in a rush and now my neck is so sore it is so incredibly uncomfortable and i think i waited too long to purge the food i really wanted to get out of me i feel so stupid for binging i did not even enjoy the food i ate i just ate it to be eating i keep looking at myself in the mirror and wishing i looked like the girls i see on pinterest i used to lie to myself and tell myself it was not real but it was a huge cope because very skinny people definitely exist i tried being happy in my body but i cannot pretend anymore i feel embarrassed i have not posted on anything ed related in years but it feels nice to get this all out,1,144
i hate that i am centering my ed around my loved one i have been disordered for years and years i have had a friend for about a year now that also has an ed i love her sm in in love with her i never loved anyone more then her i am sure all i think about is being as underweight as i can for her whenever i slightly gain my thoughts are that she does not love me anymore it is so hard not to question if she loves me even if i gain i have shared my concerns before she is lovely of course she will still love me if i gain i do not bring it up anymore to not bother her she should not have to feel like she has to keep reassuring me i do not want to drain her but now every thing i eat every thought i have is weighed on eat this or loose the person you love the most have her disgusted with you or loose a lil more have her love you more or leave you and it is exhausting the breakdowns and panic attacks i have wether ill loose her love or not when ik ill always have it i have a fear of abandonment ik and i just would feel so crushed to loose the best thing that is happened to me my v bsf it makes me feel lonely crazy silly sometimes has anyone with an ed before experienced this i am sure people have to an extent when you love someone you want to be viewed in their best light at all angles i just want her to love me more and continue loving me and even though ik my weight will not change her love for me i cannot shake the doubt,1,308
help i took a bisacodyl suppository and i pooped my pants advice 3 hrs ago i took it and had a small bm i started farting a lot then i went to the bathroom and noticed poop on my pants and underwear it is mucousy poop every time i fart now and i feel so gassy i have never had this issue before with this suppository i do not abuse laxatives either i only took it because i have not had a poop in a few days now i feel extra bloated how long will this mucousy farting happen how can i debloat from this lots of water and limit food intake for the next 12hrs,1,116
dreaded this dinner party and i was proven right i was dreading seeing these people family friends that i only see every few months for some context i am currently at a low normal bmi down from obese last year due to well a highly restrictive undiagnosed eating disorder and my family is all taking ozempic so weight loss has been a massive topic of discussion i will also add that i am in my mid twenties living at home because the cost of living is too expensive even on my engineer s salary in my area so these family friends that i see every few months last time i saw them was probably early january i have lost weight since then even though i was a normal weight then too i am bordering on underweight right now and i saw this lady that is known me since forever and she is blown away by my weight loss she had already complimented my weight loss in january but she said that whatever she is doing referring to me is what i need to do you are doing amazing what is your secret this lady is fit early fifties walks a few miles per day she does not need to lose weight not that anyone needs to of course but she is definitely at a healthy weight idfk to the what is your secret question thankfully this group of people is noisy and rowdy enough that her question got kind of buried so i ignored it but it is so fucking triggering i do not know what to say to people somehow it feels validating but also invalidating like i feel accomplished for losing it but i do not want to look healthy part of my disorder is i really really want to look sick i want people to see me and feel bad they ever thought i looked fat i want them to be worried that i am going to die because i am sick so while it does make me feel like i am doing a good job it also makes me think i am not sick and even though i do not look physically sick i am very very much mentally ill,1,374
anyone else see weight loss as a silver lining when sick i have been sick with norovirus for 3 days and have not been able to keep anything down even fluids it is been coming out of me nonstop from both ends and i have already she would like 6lbs water weight and that is the most i have lost in a long time because i am pretty sure i have plateaued i am truly miserable but i also want to stay sick just to lose a little more messed up,1,91
how is it possible i have been attempting recovery over the past week and have upped my intake from gt 600 calories per day around 1400 lt i would not say it is going well as my ed behaviours have started to creep in again so while i promised myself to stop calorie counting and that i would stop weighing my food i have just not been able to then i made the mistake of weighing myself yesterday and today and have gained gt over a kilogram in a week lt but how is this possible if i am still restricting i just want to give up,1,107
bad er experience rant numbers relating to heart rate and body weight percentage no weights why is weight loss celebrated no matter the because i checked into the er for chest pain and low heart rate last night i looked like shit in my pajamas with an unwashed face and greasy hair but the woman checking me in took my drivers license and said i looked wonderful today i said what and she pointed at my drivers license picture from when i was super morbidly obese and actually smiling dressed up and not in the er for chest pain and said again you look wonderful today they basically decided i was having a panic attack before they even looked at me i worked up the nerve to tell them about my an diagnosis because i know it is the because of my hour dropping so low after a lifetime of normal heart rates the doctor came in and asked why my primary doctor was so worried about my heart rate i told him that i lost xxx pounds gt  61  lt of my body weight in 1 year and that she said any heart rate under 50 bpm means i should go to the hospital my hour regularly rests in the low gt  40s  lt lately but the night before my watch woke me up saying it was at gt  35  lt and that entire day i had felt very wrong with tightness and pressure in my chest he did a bunch of tests and after a few hours he sent me home and told me to take a xanax he also threw out there that his 60 year old father s heart rate is gt  45  lt and that he is healthy so it is just normal bradycardia and to keep up the exercise except i am 22 years old and i literally do not exercise at all i live an extremely sedentary lifestyle before he sent in the discharge paperwork he congratulated me on my weight loss again i used to love being congratulated for it it fueled me to keep going now it feels like being kicked in the chest i hated myself when i was extremely obese my whole life but i hate myself even more now and have a whole host of negative effects i feel like i just need to get sicker and sicker until people take me seriously but i do not know how much sicker i can fucking get i am in so much pain and my heart is not well but nobody will take me seriously or help me,1,438
recovery is hard i wish i was just normal with food i have been improving and it is making me notice how hard it is to be normal and what warped choices i make everyday does that make sense like being conscious of it feels so much more bad than somehow justifying it it feels like torture i hate when i am fully aware that i am full but my mind keeps pushing me to eat more i hate when i immediately try to throw up afterwards and actively have to restrain it i hate when i plan a day of eating only to realize it was restrictive as hell and it causes me to binge because i am too hungry later on i hate when i plan my meals but get pressured or guilted to eat something and it messes up my entire flow i hate when i make expensive food only to throw it up minutes after i hate when i check my weight 3 times a day and get disappointed that i did not lose 30 pounds in the last 4 hours i hate how aware i am during it all that i know it is wrong and that i actually do not want to do it at all that i am going to have to try again and likely mess up many many more times before i ever get it right does any recovering person have this too the fact i am mentally stable enough to see right from wrong now somehow makes it all the more tortuous,1,262
not underweight for the first time in years i reached a really low point in late january after struggling with anorexia since 2021 and ended up with a few hospital scares i had attempted recovery before and at points i considered myself recovered but whenever i started to push the border of slightly underweight healthy i would relapse i relapsed really hard last summer after gaining some weight in recovery and spiraled quickly this affected my mental and physical health relationships schoolwork and career i am in graduate school and it felt impossible to research and allow my mind to handle data while thoughts about food filled my mind i took the step to really try my best with recovery after recognizing my disorder s impact on myself and others but gained weight so rapidly i went from a bmi in the gt  15s  lt to gt  high 18s  lt in about two months i am not sure if i am really struggling with extreme hunger which i have in the past but i just constantly want to eat even when i do not feel hunger and have eaten enough and the things i want to eat are typically high in sugar sodium and saturated fat i know that these are what a body craves in recovery to restore damage but i just wish i could have any sense of control when it came to food before i was underweight i was overweight i just feel like i will never be able to eat a normal healthy amount of food i either want to eat everything or nothing amp it can be one for months before returning to the other just seems like it will never end anyone else struggling with this in recovery,1,294
my ed is back and i do not want it to go away i have struggled with an ed since i was 12 i have reached a very low point and decided to take recovery seriously i lived happily without counting calories or checking my stomach ten times a day and thought i was good to go for the rest of my life one day out of nowhere it came back all those thoughts i used to have on my mind are back all the crazy habits are back i am 22 now and i am back to where i was when it started it is turning my mind into such a dark place and it is all i think about all day i do not know how long it will take this time to recover since i want to reach my gw before i even take it seriously,1,149
throwing out everything i make it is bankrupting me ill spend all day obsessing over making a lunch or dinner or some elaborate meal with safe food being my only meal of the day i like to get wild with these high volume cheats to the point where i literally do nothing all day but just plan this all out to have before i go to bed usually or at noon then go drop a boatload of cash on this stuff konjac noodles sauces you know all the real expensive stuff then come home prepare it for like 2 hours clean up and end up usually just going oh it is late or i have to go do something as i have wasted so much time that ill throw it in the fridge which goes into the trash inevitably i refuse to touch anything that is not made by me and eaten right away or just throw it out it is become a habit it is killing me i have done it every night this week and i have barely eaten because of it i feel like a waste of a human for not even just consuming the sparse amount of food that i make and in turn now feel like i have to not waste as much by not eating as much i have blown so much money and continue to as i will do this every day and no end in sight at least if i was consuming it then i would not be broke and have yet another thing to be ashamed about,1,266
had a disturbing dream of eating chicken i have never really had food dreams ever i am vegetarian for non ed reasons i just decided on not eating animals last night i had a dream where my family had a bbq event and in my dream i was bingeing on a whole roasted chicken i did not really finish any parts i got from the chicken like i took one bite from the tights took one from the legs took one from the chest and the wings and in my dream i realised that i am eating an actual animal and i am not willing to do that and became really sad about it still in the dream i was worried that i might get sick from consuming meat i have read that if you keep up with a meat free diet long enough than you have to be careful of re introducing meat and my brother was there i shared my worries and regrets that i ate meat even though i decided not to and i think i might get sick from it and he reassured me that it is okay if i want to be vegetarian one occasion of me eating chicken will not change anything i am taking this way too serious it is fine i can just return to my normal diet the next day it was not even good in my dream it was tasteless or blunt and left me really upset even after i woke up,1,252
clogged my boyfriends shower drain a new low for me trigger warning this is gross like pukey and gross so like context my boyfriend knows about my ed but i do not want my ed to interfere with my relationship so when i am with him i suck it up and try my best to act normal because i am trying to care more about him than i do about my ed like i do not want to prioritize my ed over him and the day i do that i have told myself i have to recover so like no matter what i have to act normal when i am with him anyway so i was making dinner for both of us tortellinis with tomato sauce and we ate and i ate a smaller portion than him like smaller bowl and all and i was fine but suddenly after dinner i started internally freaking out about the amount of pasta i ate i felt full and it makes me feel insane i have been doing pretty well these past few months but recently i have stopped smoking weed and i am hitting a bit of a snag in my semi recovery journey i do not usually purge i have not purged in like 8 months until now but tonight the urge just like was unbearable i told my boyfriend id go shower and guiltily purged in the shower because i am a disgusting little shower purger and i hate myself for it the drain at my house is like big and just like a metal grate type thing and you cannot like block it to run a bath or anything the shower at my boyfriends house however is a shower bath type thing so you can put a stopper to fill the tub so i am purging and then after i got it out i feel better but then the drain clogged cue me freaking out and frantically scooping up the bigger pieces and tossing them in the toilet while standing in watered down puke and wondering how the hell i am going to unclog the drain i freaked out for like 10 minutes and like stuck my fingers down the disgusting drain which like drains are fucking gross it is like at the top of my list of things i absolutely do not want to touch directly with any part of my body much less stick my fingers in it but to no avail all hope was lost but i saw the plunger and i was like what the hell i have nothing to lose and it worked thank god he has no idea and i feel terrible i am so embarassed this is a new low i will never tell him obviously but the guilt is making me feel gross i like power washed the shower but i still feel so bad but yeah tldr do not purge in the shower,1,493
i am tired i am just so fucking tired of living like this i am in recovery and i have been two months clean longest i have lasted i have been in and out of recovery since i was 12 and i am really hopeful that it will work this time but it is so very hard my stomach hurts all the time and there is nothing i can do about because my body is not used to eating normally it is almost unbearable and i am seriously considering checking myself into an eating disorder clinic but that thought is so scary honestly i do not know what to do i am just so tired and in so much pain,1,120
diagnosis soo this may be a dumb question but are there any of you out there who have an eating disorder but are not diagnosed i guess i am self diagnosed as i never went to see a professional but uhm yeah i can tell you i suffered anyways my point is that it seems like the few people i have told about my issue think it is not real because i was not diagnosed so i guess i am trying to ask the internet whether i am crazy or not d,1,92
ex gum addict i binged restricted a lot the last months now i am doing much better but still feel constantly my intestines moving like fluidand air moving it feels like sticky fluid i do not know how to describe it better i am certain it is from the excessive amount of sf gum and candy i chewed because that is when the symptoms started but i could not stop because it kept me from the actual binge it does not get better has anyone had experience with this kind of pain will it ever go away it is so annoying,1,101
can extreme hunger be caused by antidepressants now a little stupid question that probably is just a cry for help and does not have a clear answer but can extreme hunger just be a because of the meds i was prescribed risperidone duloxetine because it is started nearly right after i started taking them the end of february and my endocrinologist also thinks they are the because i have stopped taking the meds for some time a couple of times already and nothing changed but i am meeting with my psychiatrist next week and hopefully they help me i jsut need it to end and lose at least half of the gained weight back because i am extremely depressed and uncomfortable all the time now because of it and i cannot just go all in and stop focusing on my appearance i have tried but i am just a vain person i am tired of feeling miserable and helpless and like i lack any willpower when before for almost a year i did so much extreme shit like it was nothing and was so strong,1,185
tried to recover stopped being underweight then relapsed laughing out loud i got to the point where you could see my sternum hair was falling out and my boobs looked like empty socks so i started eating again two months ago and just did not stop it was still so hard and i felt like my desire for food controlled me as do most impulses i do not want to be defined by struggle i am more than this i am no longer in the two digit range and i look healthier but i feel so large i feel fat when there is any on my body in any amount i want to peel my skin off it is always there and i am always aware of it i hate mirrors i hate this i look at girls and compare our bodies all the time i want to be as skinny as they are i feel like a failure for hindering my progress my grandmother is really worried and has tried to talk to my dad about my weight but i have been gaslighting her i hate beeing so manipulative to keep this up i get so irritable around food i cried because she bought me a bbq sandwich for dinner once and i could not eat it,1,218
i am getting older and my ed is still here this sucks so much,1,14
you can still receive an anorexia diagnosis when you are not uw psa not all diagnostic criteria has to be met to be diagnosed with any mental illness including anorexia nervosa since being severely uw is listed as a diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa most people with struggle with anorexia try to get sicker one of my worst fears was being diagnosed with atypical anorexia as it made me feel like i was not sick enough to be a real anorexic and then i got diagnosed by first psychiatrist with atypical anorexia and my life went to absolute shit there is no actual difference between anorexia nervosa and atypical anorexia it is still anorexia it is horrible and it is deadly amp  x200b i kept telling myself i had to get sicker to be valid even though my health was wrecked and my life was falling apart but i refused to get help until i could qualify for the exact bmi requirement for real anorexia eventually i started seeing a different psychiatrist when my family moved and despite being at a bmi of gt  18 5  lt she diagnosed me anorexia nervosa because was good at her job and had experience in working with eating disorders by that i mean that she listened to i have never been severely underweight my bmi was gt  17 6  lt at my absolute worst lean muscles and big boobs are heavy but that does not change the the severity or danger of my illness amp  x200b so basically this post is to say do not let the fear of being diagnosed with the wrong type of anorexia stop you from trying to get a diagnosis or treatment if you like me were diagnosed with atypical anorexia your anorexia is still valid and unhealthy and so incredibly dangerous this label does not say anything about you but says a lot about the person who diagnosed you if you can consider trying to find someone else the right healthcare professional will understand,1,337
who was the first person you told find out about you are ed and do you regret them knowing for me it was a really good friend of mine it just slipped while we were talking on text and while it did feel good to tell someone and also to receive so much love validation and support for it i do regret it as i feel like it has negatively impacted our friendship in some ways and i feel like they now just view me as someone always hiding behind their problems instead of actually doing something about them even though i am pretty sure that is not the case but my brain will not stop convincing me of that so i do feel that maybe them never knowing about it would have lessened the damage to our friendship to a certain extent what about you guys,1,147
prom problem my prom is coming up in just a few weeks and i bought my dress around a month ago it is so pretty but since then i have been restricting so i have lost xx amount of weight my mom explicitly told me that if the dress is too big come the day of prom because i keep restricting she will not do any alterations i do not really know what to do because i want to reach my gw for prom but the dress will likely be too big if i do i was thinking of just maintaining until after prom but the idea of eating at maintenance freaks me out so much i guess there is no need to ask for advice because i know exactly what i should do in this situation but i just really really do not want to,1,146
i hate when people say shit like this trigger warning anorexia and gaslighting i am recovered but just because i am does not mean i do not get hurt by comments like you just did it for attention or you got over it i do not understand why some people think they should say stuff like this it is really triggering to hear and has caused me to relapse before i am a male and people do not usually think men can be anorexic but i had a real problem with it for along time and i am sick of people not taking it seriously even though i nearly died from it i just want to let everyone know that you are not alone in the struggle you are valid and you are loved,1,134

does anyone else eat drink something someone else made so today my mother made me an orange pop ice cream float and when i said oh she asked if i wanted it and i said yes because i felt bad she went through the trouble of making it for me but now i am scared to drink it this happens to me a lot with basically anyone who makes me something,1,71

anyone else stare at pics of food i love the volume eating subreddit i spend so much time on there just scrolling it is satisfying looking at things i cannot have it literally mesmerizes me like i will spend hours it is not even mealspo like some people like it is literally just regular food actually hypnotizing,1,57
anyone got any advice for constipation tmi i know but for context i have had stomach issues literally my whole life so it is not unusual for me to be a little backed up doctors think i have a type of ibs but are still unsure as to what it is at this point i have given up and accepted it recently though it is been really bad like a whole ten days without going i know my ed is making it worse but alas if i could stop it i would have by now my doctor used to tell me to use senecot max strength because it was the only thing that worked but in recent years it is like whenever i go back on it my stomach starts cramping and i end up with diarrhoea so i am looking into alternatives i have tried more fiber to no avail anyone else have this problem do i go back on senecot anyway i do not know if i can trust myself not to abuse it,1,176
got up the nerve to admit myself to inpatient now the clinic i want to go to will not take people below a certain bmi help advice i am really scared of recovery but i do not want to live my life with anorexia and therapy has not been helping my therapist agrees inpatient is a good idea only the clinic i want needs me to be over bmi gt  17 5  lt which i am very much not hovering around gt  16 5  lt i understand they are not equipped for the potential medical risks and for weight restoration but i do not know what to do now i am not a minor but i am young and live with my parents who i have been lying to saying my bmi is around gt  17 3  lt so they think gaining the necesarry weight in time should be easy it is not and i do not know if i can willingly gain weight in my current environment what do i do,1,172
tired of the sad looks and comments truly and honestly i am sick and tired of being told i have lost weight or i look so skinny can no one have an original thought or maybe be mindful and not comment on other s bodies a couple months ago an old friend came into my job and looked at me with the saddest eyes i stg you look so thin you have to eat that is what they said as if i am not trying to i know i am unhealthy i am trying just give me a break man some grace or something even worse is when if i hang out with someone outside of work where i am not wearing hoodies etc i have been told way too many times omg you are so much smaller than i thought and like that really makes my mind explode like so people do still think i am fat too it is the worst of both worlds,1,166

does one acquire a personality when they recover or work on getting better my biggest fear is committing to recovery to only be the same person as i am only at a higher weight does one stop the continuous thinking about food and actually love life and not just wake up to eat the same fixed things and feel the existential void after being done or is having a personality a hurdle on its own unrelated to having an ed,1,80

high res i want to clarify that i hate these terms low res high res med res because restriction is restriction but how sustainable is high res really i have been doing it for the last few months yikes cannot believe that it is been that long and it is been really affecting me especially in the cold i am getting similar symptoms to the first round of ed that i had most noticeably the fact that i cannot resist food sometimes   when i do eat it feels out of control even though it is just a normal amount of food in fact i eat anywhere between 1200 1800 a day some days over 2000 so i am really reluctant to call this a relapse i do not have a scale so i cannot track any physical damage other than i feel relatively unwell but the thing is tons of people diet at 1200 1400 1600 calories   why is it messing with me so much and why is it so bad if i do it has anyone had anything really bad happen from eating at normal dieting amounts,1,188
vitamins is just as difficult as eating food i struggle with taking vitamins prescribed by my doctor they are very much needed vitamins are the same as food for my ed brain i just cannot take them is this a common ed problem or a me problem i cannot find others voicing the same odd thoughts and behaviors and i feel so stupid i want to take them to stay out of hospital and to avoid having others interfering with my problems but it is just as difficult as eating food and it is frustrating i am convinced they will make me gain weight stop me from losing weight and mess with my appetite dumb common edthoughts if it is an ed problem it might be easier to fight but if it is a me problem i am doomed,1,139

calorie recommendations in recovery tw calories no actual s in recovery i have been looking into the homeodynamic recovery method   and i know that if you are at risk for refeeding they recommend starting by adding x calories every few days until you get to x calories   that makes sense well if you are not at risk for refeeding it looks like they encourage starting at the recommended calorie amounts minimum provided in this article   is this true there is no need for gradual uptake until you reach these levels i can not find a consensus on this through all of my searching it looks like most say you can start at these levels what do you guys think amp  x200b,1,121
parents want to to weigh myself hell no not recovering not planning to attempt i have not weighed myself since like november because i was in a terrible binge phase and when i saw the number i just quit weighing myself and then suddenly something hit in my brain and i lost my appetite because of the study workload and life events and kind of have been restricting and the clothes from my uw life period fit pretty well while other ones need a belt but like i do not want to know the effing number that is too much to process for me and my parents have seen and observed my eating disorder for like 4 years already and they still want me to weigh myself like weekly why cannot they understand the fact that knowing my weight is the last thing i want to know i honestly could not care less atm how much i weigh with all of the stuff i need to do especially with the amount of articles i read daily and writing my final work i mean yeah i lost my ability to eat but why do they even care at this point after 4 years of torment why do they care now how much i weigh and not how i felt and feel,1,220
i am so sick of comments i 15 have been living with my grandfather for about 2 years throughout these years hes done nothing but jokingly make comments about me being a pig eating so much mostly because i have always been a volume eater with restriction i have lost significant weight i am not uw but id saw i am   average thinner side of average i do not know it makes me sick to my stomach and its pushing me further into this i have tried to explain i hate it and he will not listen i hate everything man i want to just stop eating all together it does not help that i thinj i gained because i have been feeling so hungry recently ahgg i hate this,1,130
i am not underweight and i hate it no one takes me seriously because i am not underweight i am in the normal bmi range and i am struggling now more than ever i do not lose weight because i am in a constant binge restrict cycle everyone thinks i am eating normally because i am hiding it from my family i eat in front of them but i restrict in private i hate it i wish i was underweight like i once was i feel now depressed more than ever and i am contemplating suicide to end this pain this is literal hell i am in hell i am suffering and i wished people noticed i told my therapist but it seems like he does not even care because i am not underweight i will never recover because i will never like my body especially not now,1,148
trauma abuse and my stupid shitty ed content warnings discussion of sexual abuse and csa as it relates to my eating disorders this is not a vent and i do not go into any specific traumas i am just trying to sort shit out in a way that makes sense i certainly hope i did not imply this but i am very firmly of the belief that nobody deserves sa regardless of their size or body gt the ways that sexual abuse made me feel out of control and well fucking terrible duh directly reflect the ways my ed manifests particularly when it comes to my looks i find myself thinking and wishing i could just disappear erase the body features that are sexualized and return to a form where i cannot be wanted csa throws a wrench in this there is some complexity given that i was not safe then either but the csa coincided with my awareness about the expected body development which is maybe where this pathology keeps hooking me    lt gt  i think there is also something to be said for my vanity though there is a desirable body type i am looking for i still want to be desired but on my own terms a body i have made this way i have controlled exactly how i am seen and perceived i want to be desired for something i did instead of something i am lt disclaimer of course this is just how my shit affected me,1,252
caught my little sister 10y engaging in ed content i do not know what to do i have a younger sister that is half my age and she has a tiktok account just an hour ago i caught her reposting things about weight and when i went to check her comments she commented something along the lines of i am kg is that okay on a kpop tiktok account it is a very low number and mind you  she is 10 she also liked a few posts about workouts and losing weight and it is really hard to look at i want to move her away from looking at that stuff i put on resticted keywords on her account but i am afraid she will still encounter some pro ed posts from time to time it also does not help that she is already seen some and even commented on stats she is so young and i do not want her going down the same path as me but also she is one of those kids that will have a meltdown if she is off tiktok completely i do not know what to do does anyone have advice,1,198

i want to recover so badly but this is all i know i have had anorexic behavior since the fifth grade i would stop eating for days at a time and then i would eat junk food in the morning school lunch and then nothing in the afternoon i wanted to be as skinny as all the other girls in my grade now i do not want to be skinny anymore but this is all i know i went through a few years where i ate sparsely and mostly junk food i never looked in the mirror the thoughts and urges came back around the end of 2023 full force now it is starting to feel like i can recover i just do not know how to be normal i have never felt it in so long,1,137
does anyone ever actually recover like for real i have been in recovery for almost a year and i have just been struggling so much with this hopelessness i have maintained a healthy weight this whole time and i am still eating healthily my boyfriend has been amazing and so beyond supportive of me in my recovery and i appreciate him so much for everything he does for me but even a year into recovery i still absolutely hate my body with every single fiber of my being i feel wrong i do not feel like i fit in my body i feel like i am grotesque i can sometimes look in the mirror when i am completely naked and be fine with how i look but then i go to get dressed and nothing looks right nothing fits right not literally like they are the right size nothing feels right no matter what i wear or how i do my hair or makeup or what i weigh i just feel like there is something wrong with me and i will never be able to feel right i am so so tired of hating who i am does it ever actually get better like does that wrong feeling ever go away,1,211
when do you know if it is too far hi it is me once again i told my mom ab how i was not eating she took it seriously for thirty minutes at the grocery store barely two days later i put a bag of snack size oreo s in the cart a week ago you were not eating lunch to be skinny and now you want oreo s i cannot do this anymore but she does not understand that it is not just wanting to lose a little weight for summer it is so bad and has been for years i cannot tell her i have repeatedly gone throught the cycle of restricting lying to her and binging for years she does not know that i have to wait until a certain time to eat but i am really scared i have really not been good about eating a little something the past few days i am not dizzy but my face tingles i cannot breathe in too deep or my chest hurts like something i have never felt i am not underweight but i just really do not want to die my therapist already has suspicions about how accute my appendicitis was and how it happened after eating cake at my birthday party she says eating too much after fasting does not because appendicitis but it can inflame it i have not told her anything about it but i feel like she just knows i do not want to give myself an extra illness on top of the preexisting one,1,262

my mind hates me so i have been trying really hard to eat more than once a day and i have been doing pretty well but this morning i went and looked in the mirror and i could not see my ribs anymore i should be happy and i was but just for a spilt second before my mind started betraying me i guess i find myself body checking a lot and it smashes my self esteem every time i want to get better be healthy and stop thinking of numbers all the time why is it so difficult,1,99

shopping with an ed as a child and as a teen i absolutely adored fashion from wearing clothes to making them to shopping my frilly feminine style was a perfectly implemented aspect of my identity for a while this was only enhanced when i developed anorexia i wanted to feel pretty and small and wear clothes that accentuated that but as i move into my 8th year of having an eating disorder that has changed shopping is the most devastating triggering part of my life trying on clothes feels like i am being repeatedly kicked in the teeth things fit but not the way i want to them to and never mind how i feel about the size i am wearing my standard has dropped from looking for the perfect piece of clothing to finding something i feel pretty in to just finding something i can tolerate wearing this transition has been devastating i am 21 and i am graduating from college and i need to take grad pictures but i have tried on 25 dresses from 7 stores over 2 months i have finally settled on something that is the wrong color and does not feel like me but it fits in a way that is not triggering i need these photos and i am so proud of myself for making it this far but i feel so sad for that little girl who was in love with ruffles and puffed sleeves so i would love to hear if anyone has similar experiences any wisdom,1,256
bos bowl obsession syndrome trigger warning for lax abuse it is been a while since i last posted here to paraphrase summarise on that i was basically asking how many enemas is too many enemas since then i have been going completely downhill almost daily drinking sena tea every few days doing enemas it was not even entirely about weight i got stuck in these thoughts about needing to be empty constantly worrying about potentially getting constipated obsessing and worrying about having impacted bowls a good portion of my days have been fixated on bowl movement and the concept of being full of shit anyway it got to the point where i was actually worried about myself so i talked to my psychiatrist about it with a whole load of shame turns out that not only is this all a form of purging but it is actually classified as an obsessive disorder bos bowl obsessive disorder i do not know if anyone can relate to this but if there is any chance that other people here have had similar obsessions i just want you to know you are not alone and you are not gross at the end of the day we are all suffering from mental illness and there can be help found out there apparently this niche form of ocd is pretty common in people with eating disorders and also those of us that suffer from ibs i am not sure what the point in this rant is i suppose i just wanted to put myself out there in the chance that some of you can relate and are unsure of why you are having these thoughts,1,279

confused what eating disorder i even have i have legit never in my life struggled with weight or food issues until i was around 18 i am 19 now in my sophomore year of college even in hs my actual relationship with food was really healthy as a kid i was really picky with food and the type of textures i would eat but i had a healthy mindset in terms of never checking calories or worrying about burning off meals or gaining weight i grew up in a household with lots of sweets and candy and any junk food snacks really my parents are both healthy weights and never had to give much thought about what they ate i was easily able to eat directly from a huge bag of family sized chips in moderation and just stop eating when i was full even if i did not finish my plate i would just leave it and forget about the food i actually lost weight in high school during my junior and senior year during quarantine the opposite of most people ik because of lack of concern about eating like i was not restricting on purpose i would just genuinely forget to eat and had a small appetite i was always a naturally thin person and never really weighed myself often or focused on the scale i find it really odd that at my lowest weight during hs about 10 pounds less than i am right now i had the healthiest relationship with food i was slightly underweight during that time but i was not doing any restriction to maintain that weight i loved eating out getting fast food never counted calories i would legit order whatever i wanted using calorific sauces unknowingly drinking full sugar soda as a treat i really did not know much about nutrition and i do not think i had any knowledge about a healthy or unhealthy diet i do not think i made the healthiest options in terms of food however i had very small portions of the food i would get now when my freshman year of college hit i gained the classic freshman 15 pounds and reached my highest adult weight due to the unlimited access to the dining hall lots of drinking and eating out downtown at restaurants with my friends it is sad because my knowledge of nutrition began with my nutrition class my first quarter this was the first time in my life i became aware of what i was eating i began searching up more information about diets and certain foods but i was not obsessed just kind of glad i had access to that information as i drank more alcohol and bought food from the market with my swipes cookies ice cream candy chocolate frozen meals just any junk food i was not really thinking about the calories this is until i stepped on a scale for the first time in a while at our local university gym i was honestly terrified by the number it was still within a healthy bmi but because i had gained the weight so fast my fall and winter quarter of freshman year i just felt super uncomfortable with my body because i am 5 2 i was easily able to notice the extra 15 pounds i have never weighed that much in my life i vowed to go on a diet and downloaded my fitness pal after researching how to lose weight i began searching up how to lose weight fast and began a 800 1000 calorie diet it consisted of mostly protein bars and energy drinks like celsius or alani nu i was not really strict about the type of food i was eating as long as it fit my calories i stopped drinking my calories though because i thought it was a waste i would eat cookies and popcorn and cake still but very small portions and only trackable foods it was so bad i was counting gum and cough drop calories after a few months i was routinely going to the gym to weigh myself i had lost around 10 pounds and genuinely stayed consistent within that time period i never binged or even knew what bed was to be honest in the summer i kind of maintained my weight because i was being sedentary and just focused on playing video games i counted calories still and continued using a lot of caffeine i did not really pay as much attention to counting calories but kind of just ate easily trackable food it is not until the late summer where i started learning about the importance of protein and fiber i think this is where my binging started it was mostly just binging on healthy things like carrots kimchi blueberries strawberries watermelon but i was eating past my fullness cues so i think it was still considered a binge regardless i kind of did not pay as much attention during the summer and i was not as disordered as my freshman spring quarter fs now today as a sophomore when i got my new apartment i began obsessively watching mukbangs weight loss videos looking at inspiration on pinterest i would look at the beautiful thing instagram girls on my home page and wish i looked like them i would not starve myself entirely and it is really interesting because i do not have issues eating out with people however i always search up the menu before going to places and try to compromise with myself i do not always order the lowest calorie food and i will still occasionally eat fast food but recently last quarter i would restrict and eat 1200 and then binge eat on weekends and like the more stereotypical binge foods i am talking binging on oreos ritz crackers ice cream popcorn chips candy bars chocolate some of these binges were probably like 4k calories i would wake up the next day and feel really guilty but i would not cut to below 1200 the next day right now i am eating around 1 2k calories a day still trying to lose weight i do not know if i am disordered because i do not binge every weekend i do not follow a strict step goal anymore however i am completely obsessed with watching what i eat in a days or obese people eating to put me off of food i constantly think about food and plan my next meals and what time i will eat them i deleted my fitness pal but i still count calories on my notes i feel really uncomfortable when i go over i also am ashamed to admit this but i picked up nicotine because i heard online it was an appetite suppressant i am not entirely addicted to vaping ill usually go 1 3 days without it unintentionally and not think about it however ik its unhealthy because i already feel my lungs r weaker its dumb too because vaping only made me binge eat more so i have decreased my vaping by a lot recently i lost my period and i have low lh and my parents think that its just a natural problem i also pretty much lost all of sex drive so i am in a relationship where i feel 0 sexual attraction and it makes me sad i have not told my parents or my doctor about my severe calorie restriction i am so lost about what eating disorder i even have by the way i have maintained the same weight pretty much i am a healthy bmi but on the lower end i genuinely only want to lose a few more pounds like 5 pounds i just hate living everyday counting calories and worrying about food it is also sad that ill budget my calories on friday or saturday for drinking by compensating earlier in the day and eating less if ik ill be drinking i always go for hard alcohol or setzlers over calorific cocktails or non light beer because i am afraid of the calories i really do not know what kind of eating disorder i have i do not purge by the way and i have never thrown up my food i have only had it happen once and that was literally because i smoked weed and ate so much food i could not stomach it like it was not intentional i compulsively weigh my food and am obsessed with high protein high fiber low fat foods i feel like i have watched every single video about diets keto carnivore intermittent fasting and even documentaries warning about the dangers of fast food i do not understand what is wrong with my brain though i still am completely fine with eating fast food and i still eat out with my friends but it is hard for me to enjoy the meal as long as i ate very little before to compensate for it i feel so much food guilt and i wish i never started tracking calories my 1 fear is gaining weight i honestly feel so lost as well nobody in my family or any of my close friends know that i have these obsessive food thoughts i am not thin enough where it is prevalent i have an eating disorder i think most people just view me as a regular weight and cannot even tell i am restricting i spend every day thinking about food and i want to stop i find myself looking at ed twitter threads i also want my period back but i do not want to gain weight i do not know what to do because i do not even know what eating disorder i have bed ednos orthorexia i hate that my mind is a calorie calculator and i cannot eat without estimating or knowing the calories of the meal i just consumed i cannot think of food anymore as anything but calories i have not binged in like 2 weeks luckily,1,1681
should i report people who private message me asking about my weight or should i just ignore them,1,18
do you think eds can be self diagnosed i am diagnosed by the way so not seeking a diagnosis here i think most mental illnesses should not be self diagnosed because symptoms can overlap so much and it is very complicated however with eds it is pretty easy to tell like if you fear gaining weight so you purposely starve yourself or self induce vomit after meals clearly this is not a normal thing i am pretty sure it is easy to tell if you have bulimia anorexia etc however i still believe it is best to get a professional diagnosis and get medical treatment what are your thoughts,1,109
does anyone else put a sweater across their lap before they buckle their seatbelt because i do laugh my ass off every time i drive i got to put a sweater or sweatshirt or fucking something across my lap and over my stomach so i can drive without constantly feeling like i want to rip my skin off,1,58

how not to look fat in cardigans sorry i hope this is not a weird post i love wool cardigans they keep me warmer than hoodies or thin cotton knits unfortunately they make me look a lot bigger esp if i layer them on a looser top or long sleeve and i wear long sleeve 80 of the time is there some styling tip my cardigan is round neck quite fitted and finishes above the hip would it be better if i buy oversized or a v neck to break up bulk can i only wear it with tight tanks or short sleeve i saw a photo of myself wearing this cardigan and ahdhd it triggered me to start restricting because i looked so wide and fat so this is why i ask for advice when i look for inspo online i only see them styled on skinny girls and i am nw so it makes me doubt i have the right body type,1,164
when people tell you that you look so much better not realizing you are relapsing is such a hit i was pushing so hard in recovery i was gaining and trying so hard the last couple days i have started restricting hard someone who knows i have an ran onto me and said they could tell i was doing so much better and that i was looking really good i am riding the high of the early days of restricting but i know i should not i do not want that reinforcement but at the same time yes i do,1,100

my boyfriend just handled the situation the best way he could have i hate to admit but i just purged for the first time in a while i had a habit of eating past fullness even before i developed my ed so vomiting after eating a lot is not super unusual for me so how this situation happened i had made dinner and was eating at the table with my boyfriend j he started to get full close to finishing his food but still had enough room to finish it me on the other hand started to get full halfway through but i continued to eat overall i ate a closer to normal amount through the entire day j asked if i wanted some soda knowing that it would help me feel less full he did this in an attempt to make me less likely to throw up but i used it as an opportunity to eat more i alternated between sips of soda and bites of food until only a little bit was left j had said that he would take the food away from me so i would not eat too much i will admit i got a little defensive i have had bad experiences with people taking my food before i decided i would let j supervise my last little bit of food while i asked my step dad if he wanted it for lunch tomorrow because i was starting to feel actually sick j had moved the trash can by me because i had mentioned feeling sick i told him how i did not like to be seen when i was throwing up it makes me feel too vulnerable so he walked me to the bathroom and stayed in there with me he put my hair up while i was actively purging he was more worried about me being ok in that moment than he was about me working on recovery the way he was talking to me was so sweet he tried to get me to focus on something else and not think about purging he even flushed the toilet for me once he had made sure i was ok that was that he walked me to the bedroom and turned the light off so i could lay down he is trying to get me to focus on other things and we are talking about random things right now i am making this post so my mind is not fully off of it but he is successfully distracting me i have been writing this for like 15 minutes now lol that is the best way he could have handled it i am going to too many people in my life have tried to focus more on getting me to recover while i have been actively in a situation like this instead of actually worrying about if i was ok he is the first one to ever act like this i am his first real relationship this is the first time he is witnessed me in a situation like this and he handled it as perfectly as possible,1,522

sibling ed competitiveness my sister has an ed and i do too but it has seriously split us apart to the point where i go days without speaking to her in the same house we are always competing with each other like who can eat the least who weighs the least etc i hate eating at the same table as her because i see her eyes watching my plate monitoring how much i eat and i cannot deny it but i do the same you have no idea how awkward and uncomfortable it is when we get weighed at the doctors together she always makes a comment about my weight i miss when i would talk to her everyday and tell her everything i hate this competition,1,127

people close to me are beginning to notice my weightloss and congratulating me really just feeds it starting off at a normal weight on the higher rung of it and having an eating disorder is hardly talked about getting compliments from my bf his family noticing i have lost weight and complimenting me my family noticing i have lost weight and complimenting me friends just feeding or lack thereof lol my ed saying i look good that they can notice a change people i have not seen in a couple of months now seeing me complimenting me yada yada is wiiilddd i think it is vastly different than maybe being skinny to begin with and having an ed because all i ever get now are compliments which makes my brain go ooohh yes this is what i am meant to do starve myself,1,143
weight restoration i was thinking about treatment and my hx with it and was curious to see what the requirements or indications are that someone needs weight restoration my last inpatient dietician was like i am still deciding if you need weight restoration and i do not know what makes the line clear i am also curious because i am debating at this point if i need it or not because i am trying to figure out how long i can do this or if i need to reach out it is just a weird thought i have had lately,1,100
how do i find the right therapist do you guys know any reliable platforms where i can find an ed therapist who does not promote any of the strict meal plan or not gaining too much weight bs but also at an appropriate cost i have been receiving professional health for 6 months now from a public mental health institution and while it is been helpful for me in some aspects i feel like i am progressing way too slow because of unawareness of the specialists in certain ed related problems would be perfect if you could recommend someone who you for sure know can help with managing extreme hunger,1,110
my pro ana friend so recently my friend found out i am anorexia literally the day she found out she started making jokes about it she is normally the type of person to make really weird jokes sex jokes that made the whole friend group uncomfortable but now she is making anorexia jokes and it is happening more frequently her jokes are coming off as more serious then a funny joke some of the stuff she says are stuff like you need to go on a liquid diet you cannot chew gum gum has calories there is been times where she is said these jokes in front of my other friends i am really getting tired of her i am considering unfriending her the only problem with me unfriending her is that she is in my friend group so if i stop talking to her it will be so awkward but id rather stop being friends with her then to remain friends with someone who is pro ana,1,168
just ate 30 pieces of gum in order not to binge yes ate i swallowed them i ate them like candy on the bright side i do not really feel like bingeing any more on account of the intestinal distress i have purged 2 nights in a row after 3 years clean and i started cutting again things you might say are not going great my partner caught me purging i told him i did not want to start again and i do not i just do not want to gain i promised him i would not tonight that i would wake him up if i needed to instead and then i started chewing gum to keep from bingeing you can probably fill in the rest i am eating maintenance for the rest of the week because i would rather maintain than gain and the way things are going i will gain if i do not do something i am at the weight i was last time when things started getting bad i do not want to go to rehab again probably could not even afford it if i did i just want to lose weight i just want to be thin there is no point to this post just having a bad night,1,214

anyone else feeling invalid because of your calorie intake you see how eating disorders are always portrayed and it is gt  500  lt or less calories a day or somewhere around there i eat gt  1000 1400  lt a day because i had to up my intake because i was losing too fast and my family got concerned not to mention the hunger got really bad after i restricted lower than that for a long time even though i am exercising a lot more instead of being sedentary it still feels wrong that i upped my intake and then it is interesting because i sometimes have to remind myself that because i am an active teenager who is tall the amount i am eating and burning is still dangerous some sick part of me wants to be in danger and is very happy that my health is declining ha,1,149
question about lax i had a binge and then took some dulcolax but then i felt a bit weird i felt like i was going to throw up so i decided to purge because i could not stand the feeling i think it was probably 15 20 minutes maybe less between me taking the lax and then purging i did not get everything out but enough to stop feeling so sick i am not planning on taking more lax i am just wondering if it is possible for it to absorb so quickly in which case i will expect to be shitting myself tomorrow morning and if anyone knows on average does dulcolax absorb immediately,1,115

jealous of ex friend losing weight i feel so mad at myself for gaining weight and consistently binging for the past few weeks but i am honestly most devastated because an ex friend of mine has recently lost weight we have a few mutuals and follow each other on socials and i have noticed that she is lost a lot of weight knowing that she was heavier than me was one of those fucked up things that made me feel less bad about myself and now i am spiraling and cannot get back in control i have not been able to eat normally let alone restrict to get back to where i was i wish this was not the thing driving me so insane but it is one of the things i suppress most about myself that torments me inside is how much of an envious person i am especially with appearances weight etc she already had so much more going for her than me boyfriend more friends more outgoing smarter prettier and now she is also in better shape than me i do not want to leave the house in case i see her or someone we both know i had restricted and exercised so much for months and i literally undid almost half of it over the past few months i am so frustrated,1,226

i am going fucking crazy i am writing this late at night and my mind is racing i am trying to recover on my own i had a hard binging and purging session today and i feel like crap i felt so sick and i cannot stop thinking i cannot stop thinking that it i am never going to eat again fuck recover fuck having a period fuck being a healthy weight then the absolute next second i am planning what to eat tomorrow that eating is not so bad i should be heathy and happy a couple of pounds will not hurt i love eating i should fast tomorrow i should not fast tomorrow i need to exercise tomorrow i hate exercising but i have to exercise i ate way too much today i need to get over today and forgive myself that is what everybody always says then the next second i feel pathetic and weak for thinking about eating about having such a weak constitution and giving into gluttony i can literally feel the two sides of me fighting in my head my ed is not an intruder or a tiny little voice in my head it is what is makes up me for better or for worse i cannot take it it feels like an absolute coin toss between recover and going back i know recover is the right answer but i do not want it why should i even try to recover when i feel like shit i am so scared that i if i keep giving in i will keep eating and eating and eating this is all over the place i apologize but i need to rant,1,284
how do i find someone with the same values i f21 am in eating disorder recovery i recently had to cut things off with my bf different story when i was with him i have had relapses and had to heal he did his ablsoutle best to take care of me through everything since i am no longer with him i am now in the dating pool i do not like to open up to people about my ed but i want someone who has the same body positive food freedom values as me when do i open up how do i tell them about my journey what happens if they disagree with me i am scared that they might think it is silly,1,124
relapse in early 20s recently i have relapsed pretty bad back into my ed i have dealt with it off and on since i was a pre teen and i guess i was wondering if anyone else who relapsed in their early mid20s realized how different their ed is now compared when they were younger when i was younger it was hyper fixated on vanity and physical appearance i mean sure now it definitely still has that element but i feel it has become way more of a severe control thing which is almost worst does not matter how low the number gets or skinny i look the satisfaction feeling is dependent on how successful in that day i am with my ed how lil i eat much i excercise etc,1,131
how to deal with seeing people live life i am in my first year of college and i just see everyone from my high school looking so pretty having fun having friends at the very least etc and i am just stuck in a b p amp restrict cycle that keeps me pushing everything to the future it is been 6 years since i have been telling myself i will do that when i am xxx or when i am xx people will like me and then i will try you get the point and it does not even matter my weight i got hospitalized and it still was not enough and at this point it is just like i am mentally stuck at 13 because i just have not experienced anything i have never had friends not to mention any relationship i do not go to school clubs orgs because i am ashamed to i never really do anything but eat if i am binging or obsess over eating and exercise for six fucking years i do not think i have been so envious of anything more than this i am so fucking jealous of people who just get to live i know they are probably dealing with things to but at least they can fake it that they are living i do not even have enough material for that and the thing that irks me in addition is that my depression just got 100x worse the last months of high school and especially during summer but i have already heard people gossiping ab me saying that this is why you should not go to a top university the stress breaks you and shit like that about my depression amp ed i do not know why being perceived like the stress is breaking me irritates me so much but it does lol maybe its because if that was the case i could be fine and normal if i dropped out but i know i would not be the school s competitive academics are the only thing i have left lol anyway was wondering if anyone else feels the same way or if i am just going even more insane than before just wish i never got into this mess in the first place,1,384
anyone else lowkey an alcoholic on top of their ed i do not know if this is even allowed to post here but i just want to know i have a drinking problem which is just an awful combination with the whole eating issues like i restrict all day and then most evenings i down at least one to two drinks which stresses me out because calories more than what i have eaten usually and is obviously not healthy but it is soo hard to stop i just crave that feeling of being slightly buzzed so much probably down to my crippling anxiety i guess i use alcohol as a crutch i just wish i was not so dependent on it because i would probably loose much more weight if i would be able to quit i am not looking for advise i know drinking bad in theory i am just wondering if anyone else struggles with this or i am just an idiot with no self control i cannot be the only one right,1,175
my therapist diminish my eating problems my first post ever on reddit heheh but i do not have anyone in real life to talk to about these problems that i have faced with my therapist i would not say i yet have developed an ed but i do have problems with eating certain food and numbers when i have had problems with eating before and i have told my therapist about it it seems he does not care asking about it any further which in turn has made me think i should never mention it again it has been worse these past weeks and i decided to talk to my therapist about it yesterday despite that i decided i would not i think i talked for 20 minutes or so when he from nowhere changed subject when i later read my therapist s notes it said the patient has only lost x kg it just trigged me you know made me feel so incredibly alone and i felt like i have failed and now i want to lose even more weight because of that comment am i overreacting should i never speak about this any further with him i just do not know what to do are my problems with eating not serious enough,1,214

does anyone else feel like their ed can be worsened by their body s reaction for food context i am severely lactose intolerant and i have some other undiagnosed issue relating to my stomach that has sent me to the emergency room for excruciating trapped gas when it gets that bad i have to take hydrocodone does anyone else feel like their ed is worsened because of issues like this like oh my body is punishing me for eating because i so often have no idea what the trigger is if i do not eat these issues will not happen because my stomach cannot get the issues triggered if there is nothing to trigger it i am working on doing semi recovery so i think figuring out if other people feel this way too may help,1,136

my boyfriend is on a diet and counting calories i fear i ts starting to affect me i have struggled with eds for the past 12 years mostly bulimia unfortunately i have never really had the opportunity to get specialized treatment but i have been able to go to therapy and work on things that may trigger any binging or purging it is an everyday battle but it is one that i am not done fighting my bf has also struggled with food in the past but overall has a better relationship with it a few weeks ago he decided he wanted to get on a diet and started counting calories i did not say anything since it is his choice how he wants to go about his weightloss journey i do not think i have ever talked in detail about my ed but he knows about it and has never been anything but supportive at first it was not an issue since he mostly just tries to choose healthier options whenever we eat together and add more steps to his daily rutine i saw it as an opportunity for myself to also improve my eating habits since i have not paid enough attention to what i eat lately he also does not openly discuss numbers regarding his calorie intake but lately there is been a few comments here and there that make me feel kind of uncomfortable like he will talk about how he cannot eat for the rest of the day because he is almost reached his daily limit even though it is like 2 pm or the other day we went to a party he was talking about how he was drinking way too much he simply would not eat the next day i know he is joking and he does end up eating but it is hard to hear those things sometimes because it is so reminiscent of jokes and comments i used to do except i did act on them yesterday we had a date night and i made us ramen bowls with the toppings being mostly veggies so that he would be able to enjoy it guilt free but later on i noticed him adding up the calories in an application and it made me very anxious because i am aware of how many calories ramen can have and i was afraid he would be put off by it considering we had a great time cooking together i am aware that most of this stems from my anxiety and like i mentioned i want to respect his weightloss journey and how he handles his relationship with food he might not even be as scared of numbers as i am it is just that a lot of my own healing journey has been about getting away from this type of comments and habits and having them around me lately has started to weight on me i might just have a more open conversation with him about how i am feeling that does not really worry me i just wish living with an ed was not as annoying,1,522
i think my bf and i both have anorexia and i think we are influencing each other i think we are both feeding each other s ed s he is a super picky eater hardly eats ever since i met him i have recently brought back my dormant ed and it is almost like we are both in this rut together he keeps telling me to keep up the great work and that he is proud of me and when i avoid certain foods or decline certain foods that he will order sometimes he is like i am proud of yes for resisting the urge and so on and so on and i feel bad on the same token because i will tell him about calorie counts and how he should be eating more and the rough estimate i could muster up of how much he eats in a day i will tell him i plan on working out one day and then he will also choose to work out that day too with the activity he likes doing oopsie poopsie,1,181
people with restrictive eds do you get good sleep hi those restricting esp those with very low intake how do you sleep before my forced recovery and now current relapse i got good sleep despite my low intake and brain fog and so on etc but now i cannot sleep at all i wake up in the middle of the night in pain i have hunger stress hunger insomnia whatever tf i cannot seem to go to sleep like i used to either generally i fall asleep as soon as i close my eyes but now it takes me like a minimum of 3 minutes does anyone have an explanation not looking for advice just wondering if you guys have ana insomnia too,1,123

difference between an b p and bulimia as far as i am aware the only difference is with anorexia b p subtype and bulimia is with an you are underweight and bulimia you are not also i believe restriction is more common with an b p but you can also restrict with bulimia am i wrong i was diagnosed with an b p when i was underweight but after inpatient i gained weight and am now at a healthy weight and my binging episodes have increased i have not talked to a psychiatrist in a while but i think i have bulimia now i have heard it is common for people to switch between eds anyway yeah kind of just a vent also asking about the difference and if i am right or not,1,134
can i minimize the damage of restriction by eating enough calcium i try to fit in slightly above the daily recommended daily amount of calcium into my diet even while restricting can this help with bone growth i am 18mtf and have been on puberty blockers since 14 and started hrt last year i do not want to lose out on bone growth because of my stupid ed,1,68
i am gaining weight on olanzapine help i previously posted over a week ago about being prescribed olanzapine for the constant barrage of food noise in my head that was making it impossible to focus on my work since then my weight has gone up i have been b ping almost everyday i do not even get the urge to binge because of hunger it is just needing the soothing feeling of eating i really really want to stop taking the olanzapine in some ways it did help i managed to finish the essay that i was putting off for weeks i had stretches of time where i was focused and able to read theory and write but i cannot live like this i need to stop bingeing and i have no idea how i have no idea what tools i could possibly use or ask for to deal with these urges i have tried drinking water eating higher protein meals to feel fuller stretching exercise but the urges are persistent and do not lessen with time the only thing i am considering asking for at my next appointment is vyvanse because it is used to treat bed but i am not sure if he will prescribe me that on paper i am an b p but i do not think that diagnosis fits me because i was not uw when i was diagnosed and the person who diagnosed me and continues to treat me is not a ed specialist he specialises in a different subfield of psychiatry i was just assigned to him at the public hospital i am also looking into therapy although i feel like i am probably therapy resistant after years of it so i eventually quit but now i feel desperate enough to try again although i probably do not have to money to see a private ed trained psychologist i feel like i am ranting sorry i think i just want to ask about your thoughts on the treatment you are receiving meds any specific kind of therapy and if you have found that it works for you and the behaviours that ed manifest in you,1,362
bladder trouble even after recovering tmi gross i am not sure i really count as an eating disordered person because i have autism and have sensory issues with food i am a guy but had pretty severe hypospadias until it was corrected recently so my urethra used to come out my perineum sorry tmi just for relevant anatomical info in high school for a few years i found it very hard to eat anything i became very underweight and started losing control of my bladder i am a normal weight now but i still have bladder issues i need to go maybe twice or even three times an hour i worried it was maybe diabetes but i do not have any other symptoms my biggest fear before high pressure events is my bladder is it possible my pelvic floor muscles just never recovered is there anything like kegels that might fix this,1,152
brain difference hi all i am still in recovery for the extra spicy combo of anorexia and exercise addiction one of the things i have noticed in recovery is that my brain feels rewired i honestly do not know how to describe it other than my personality drastically changed my ability to comprehend certain things has gone away and i am not nearly able to exercise anymore has anyone else experienced this does ed actually change your brain,1,78

i have extreme picky eating i do not know what to do anymore there are literally barely any meals that i like i can list on one hand the meals that i will eat i also have a really bad fear of trying new foods i cried when i saw that onions were put on my pizza and could not try them it is affecting me and my family sm because my mum is just getting really annoyed that there is literally nothing that i like except from sunday lunch pizza toast burger and garlic bread i pretty much like nothing other than those things and it is getting sososo repetitive but whenever i find a new safe food i will constantly eat that over and over until i no longer like it any advice from others who feel like this,1,141
what is a typical low calorie food that you just refuse to eat like what is something that is somewhat stereotypical for people with restrictive eds to eat that you just cannot for me it is rice cakes the texture is just not for me even though i have voluntarily eaten way worse things i would rather eat nothing than touch rice cakes even if it is topped with something delicious also konjac noodles just ew i cannot even bring myself to try them because i do not know slimy just curious laughing out loud,1,95

relapsing and my friend is not helping so i just found out that my bff also has a raging ed i was already super suspicious that she had one but i was surprised that she confided in me unfortunately i have been in recovery for the past three months and i have been making a lot of progress but this totallyy set me back i am not blaming her yet finding out that she was also struggling resurfaced old habits but i was trying to set a good example for her by eating well and not saying anything that could be triggering but she is not the same it feels like a one sided competition now where she texts me about how little she is eating and sending body checks and even talking about how tiny she is like i understand that i am her friend and that she can come to me when she needs to talk but she is essentially bragging about it she is not saying i barely ate today and i need help she is saying look how little i ate today and i understand that this might be her way of crying for help but she knows i have an eating disorder too and we all know how competitive eating disorders are and every time we meet to hang out whether we are getting food or just spending time together one of the first things she will mention is what she ate that day which is usually nothing or one piece of candy or one bite of xxx s meal and of course i always tell her that she should try to eat a little more and even if we did not have plans to get food i always offer to go somewhere and she usually accepts but after we get our food she will make a point to mention that she is purposefully eating slow and does not want to eat a lot and i am like girl i do not know how to help you but this is really fucking me up right now she has a really big support system so i do not understand why she needs to do these things and once again i understand that i am her friend and that i should be there for her but what about me she should realize how hurtful her behavior is because i know that if the roles were reversed she would be upset if she was receiving messages like that from me if things continue this way i will make sure to mention to her that i am uncomfortable but i do not want to because an issue over something like this okkk anyways rant over,1,456

harm reduction fasting for extended periods can sometimes because hives why did not anybody tell me this i was aiming to go for a 48 hour fast i got just shy of 30 hours in and i started breaking out in hives on my hipbones and chest apparently it is a thing called keto rash i would attribute it to the amount of exercise i did yesterday combined with the fasting i asked my housemate who also has done keto diets before and said he would never heard of it but sure enough when i broke my fast the rash started slowing going down and then when i woke up the next morning it was completely gone please beware if you do fasting or keto diets that this is a real thing that can happen because i honestly had never heard about this and was so confused and scared i am experienced with if and doing long fasts before but i have never broken out in a rash because of it,1,171
does anyone else just look perpetually disheveled it is extremely possible that this is a me thing and not an ed thing but at the minimum it is gotten worse i do not know how to explain it exactly i have not lost any hair i do put forth an effort maybe even too much of one where my appearance is concerned but i feel like even in a dress full makeup and meticulously styled hair i just look messy i do not know maybe it is in my head it is like there is a frequency exuding from me that says man this bitch needs some folic acid and subconsciously signals that there is something just off i have looked at myself for longer than i should trying to figure out what is up,1,135

i stopped counting calories i do not even know when or how but at some point in my recovery i just stopped it was gradual as i started by not tracking logging calories then started roughly estimating everything in my head and eventually i got to a point where i choose what to eat because it is what sounds good though that is typically a safe food but i am so proud of myself i never imagined being able to see food as something other than a number i have been trying to recover on my own and noticed this milestone today and it made me proud to see that i have made some mental progress if you are stuck in that same place i was just know it truly can get better,1,133

why does recovery hurt so much i am attempting ed recov from gt  bmi13  lt and since slowly upping my intake my body is so physically uncomfortable every day chest pains stomach pains muscle pains headaches cramps and so on and so on will this get better it is been a week and a bit of hell,1,57
just a vent being normal failed me so a while back i finally broke and decided i was done with this shit i ate whatever i wanted without thinking about calories for a long time and it was surprisingly fine weight did not pile on i got to a better mental state whoo then i decided i wanted to improve my physique in a normal healthy way got into weight training put on some muscle loving the muscle but still not content decided i wanted to drop a few pounds nothing drastic and i was going to lose it in a slow healthy way for 3 months i worked out 5 times a week and maintained a healthy calorie deficit 6 days a week for 3 months and guess what i was always hungry and nothing happened ahhhh restricting my intake at all was so hard cooking all the time denying myself foods i wanted that were right in front of me nonstop weighing and counting i thought if i were chill about it nice to myself gave into the cravings sometimes it would be chill and easy it was still so hard every day non ed diet fitness people talk like maintaining a healthy calorie deficit is the simplest easiest thing ever when starving i always thought i was an idiot for putting myself through so much when i could have just done it the nice normal easy way turns out it was so complicated and hard and stressful the amount i actually had to restrict to felt like so little but eating and working out made me more hungry and i just wanted to stuff my face every second of the day all that and i did not lose a single fucking thing in 3 months back on my bullshit for a few days now and it is blowing my mind how much easier it feels and it is actually working and i just want to cry because it is not what i wanted for myself my worst nightmare happened doing it the right way failed me still telling myself i can go back on my bullshit for just long enough to lose what i want to lose and then go back to eating and working out to build muscle after i do not know starving really feels like my only option now and i am so bitter about it,1,402
recovered yet forced to gain weight ah yes i lost gt  1 kg  lt after recovery and my mum took me to a dietician to prescribe me a much higher meal plan than i eat daily it consists of like 3 4k calories she is just trying to feel safe herself knowing that i will not lose weight ever again,1,60
bikinis ed rant about body types so i work outside on the water whichhh means dealing with the sun typically i wear long sleeves and leggings glasses and hats to avoid over tanning or sun burn and what not sometimes this leads to funny tans when i wear capris or raccoon eyes when i forget to wear a hat my glasses keep my eyes white lmao anyways i finally went on the boat for a fun dive day at my old job so having no responsibility to them or their code of dress i was finally able to just go out in a bikini i wore cute little skirt as a cover up on the boat between dives and white mesh pants when i was on land amp an orange halter top just painting the picture here i live in florida where it is hot and very normal to dress bare minimum my ed does not allow me to do this though because i am hyper self conscious and work around a lot of skinny thin american girls who are not in the slightest self conscious to walk around in bikinis i am usually covered up but that is not fair look my ed makes me hate my thighs and although in my standards i need to lose a lot of weight i know that i am not considered fat or overweight i am just more voluptuous and i have bigger boobs but this whole idea where i should shame and hide my body because of my latin figure it does not help my eating disorder and it is just not a fair thing in society i mentioned to my old coworker who was with me that i felt like it is not fair they get to wear whatever they want so since i am off and i do not work here i get to wear whatever i want she made a comment saying well like you cannot really even compare that though so wtf i am not trash talking this person she is actually super sweet and a wonderful person but like it just goes to show you how ingrained these ideas are and i do not know that shit felt like shit it really upset me and i was like damn well i am glad i do not work here anymore because at least the place where i work is more accepting of different body types,1,408
feel like i am going to regress how do you all cover over numbers i hit spoilers but it does not work is it because i am on a smartphone anyway if this gets deleted i will live with it i was bmi gt 14 lt a month ago eating barely enough to sustain me back then and also using diuretics and laxatives enemas i decided i was done feeling weak unable to do my weightlifting i love hair falling out no period etc increased my calories little by little i am at 1500 now the scale is fluctuating so much and this morning i am back in triple digits and it triggered me bad nutritionist assured me it is just water weight at this point 5lb gain overnight so today i am back to old habits because it freaked me out i feel hopeless i do not want to eat gt 1500 lt today i am hoarding food bad again and cannot stay outta the grocery store scanning labels and crying over what i want but cannot have i want to restrict least i got my enemas laxatives diuretics but i want that restriction i try to tell myself if i eat like crap today and do bad things today then i will feel like crap tomorrow which means no weightlifting tomorrow because ill be too weak which is my passion to lift therapist tells me today s food is tomorrow s fuel to do the things you love but i know i am heading into a relapse after seeing an even one hundred today i want to smash that darn scale,1,273
boobs just boobs hello everybody i think i am recovered i had written a few posts here and there last year i was deep in anorexia and was hospitalized in may for a few days it is been hard getting into recovery and have been depressed on the way i am not afraid of food anymore and not hating on my body so much i am not in danger anymore and have gained something like 6 kgs i was not super super underweight so i weight and look quite normal now i look like a woman again the thing is that reason i wanted to recover was because i thought that i could get thick and get my boobs back because i am still a teen but from all the 6 kg i gained almost none of it went to my boobs and they still look weird to me i want a thick and luscious body and i am not getting it i have been in recovery for 10 months and i still have small boobs something like a small b cup when am i going to have boobs sometimes i am so depressed about it that i think that recovery was not so worth it because i did not get the body i deserve,1,215

are you guys on edtwt i am not asking to share your username or anything i am just wondering if some of you also use edtwt or its like frowned upon in this community to me edanon feels more realistic and edtwt feels more like glamorized i know that glamourizing ed like that is bad and pretty triggering but i am curious to know if you go on there for different reasons there is a stark difference between selfharm and madeofstyrofoam and shtwt is it like that here too,1,89
aita for not hiding my relapse was going to make a throw away account and post this on aita but it involves my ed so i thought your guys s perspective might be better so basically my therapist pointed out that my bf s peace of mind kind of relies on my mental health he says things like i need you to get better because i cannot do this forever and sometimes shuts me down when i try to talk to him because i do not have the energy to deal with this right now i understand a partner should not be your everything so it hurts but seems reasonable to me i am open about my ed with everyone in my life and i am currently relapsing this makes him very stressed but it is so much work to hide it that i do not know if i can i am an adult who has been out of the family house for eight years and have not had to hide it in as long and i do not think i can go back to that because it is stress on top of stress and i honestly just do not give a fuck but if it makes my bf worried about me aita if i do not hide it i lie a lot about my depression because that is easier to hide i can pretend i did things and did not just rot in bed being depressed all day me and my therapist disagreed on this one i said that of course he does not want a partner that burdens him and i very clearly do and she said i only think that because i devalue myself so much i do not think i deserve a partner who supports me through thick and thin even if the thick is very thick what do you guys think i feel like such a jerk for being honest about my relapse but the effort to hide it is too much part of me also feels like why does not he go to a support group or therapy of his own if it makes him feel so bad why does not he do something to help himself instead of relying on me to do it for him and that thought makes me feel extra asshole ish because partnership should be mutual where i take care of him as he takes care of me,1,409
my skin restricting makes my skin look like shit i already had dry textured skin but restricting breaks me out and makes my already flakey skin look like the sahara desert i am only 19 but have deep wrinkles and creases under my eyes from the dryness making me look 2x older than i actually am i feel so gross and ugly i spend so much money on skincare products and makeup just to look like a dehydrated clown trying to be pretty i hate having to compromise with the number on the scale that makes me happy skinny and my own well being like said my skin was bad before but no where as bad as now i wish i was pretty ugh,1,124
accidentally ate meat i am vegetarian i usually get a little school lunch and in sweden we are served lunch buffet style anyway there was this spinach and tomato lasange put out and i wanted a little slice so i asked the worked nearby if it was vegetarian she said yes after eating half of what i took i noticed a weird texture in my mouth it was mince meat meat help not only have i not eaten meat in months except raw fish which i allow myself sometimes but i also feel fooled about the cals i know it will not much of a difference on my body if i accidentally ingest meat once but my whole daily meal schedule feels thrown off which might results in either a binge or fasting neither of which i want,1,138
i do not know what i was expecting but being thin enough does not make anything better i used to be bulimic and then it slowly merged into anorexia with bp elements went from a higher weight to a lower weight during my bulimic eras i gained and lost a lot but never to my point of sick enough but weirdly enough things have not become better i know i am sick enough but i am not too sick i am not healthy but i am not immediately and unhealthily in danger i am functional i do not look off putting there are anorexic people who are way smaller i am just a bulimic person who recovered by restricting maybe that makes me feel fake because i will never be a pure r anorexic i do not know it sounds so silly but i mean who said eds are logical and sensible the thing is at my higher weights i always thought being x bmi or y clothing size would make things better do not know in what ways maybe just in general i would be happier finally be sick enough i would feel something different my impostor syndrome would disappear at several points i thought i would recover once i hit z weight now that feels further away than ever maybe i was expecting to become cassie or something i do not know i do not particularly care about body image in the way that i used to but i still cannot deal with the size of my body but i think i look better than i did before i do not know what the goal of my disorder is i am fine with losing weight slowly and do not want to end up in hospital i still have weight loss goals but because i know the way my disorder works i try to be chill about it maybe i am reaching a point of harm reduction where i stay stuck in ed hell but lose so slowly that it barely counts i do not know what my point is i am less sick than i have been in the past i feel fine most of the time but being at the sick enough weight has changed literally nothing which makes me feel like the last 5 years have been a lie laugh my ass off feel free to discuss in small groups i do not know,1,408
today i fainted and hit my head so i asked my boyfriend if he could have walked on my back since my posture felt like one of a shrimp after that i got up from the floor and i do not know what happpened but next thing i notice i am lying on the floor and my head hurts my boyfriend came immediately to check on me and had a worried look on his face i got a pretty big swelling which i am treating currently with an ice bag so far no nausea and my speech is coherrent so do not think i am in a danger zone it just that this has never happened to me and i was quite bamboozled when i came to my senses it is like i woke up from a dream which lasted a nanosecond does someone have similar experiences d,1,148
recovery and normal eating feels impossible about 8 months ago i decided that i will lose weight and i did more than 30 lbs but the way i lost it was far from healthy people have started to tell me how good i looked and how they are proud of me but what they did not know was that i was miserable slipping meals overexercising obsessibe calorie counting and even chew and spit habits i noticed something is off a while ago and i came to a conclusion that i probbably have an ed my mom knew about my unhealthy habits but she thinks i am okay now as it was so easy to just eat you are not fat my biggest problem is also that whenever i say to myself that i am going to finally stop counting cals and eat intuitively or whatever a few days later i go back to feeling guilty about letting myself go and eventually undereat for a while so i can make up for it people around me are a whole another topic telling me how good i looked after losing a bunch of weight turned into pointing out my thin legs and arms and saying that i lost too much and look like i do not eat it is unimaginable how much it hurts me because i simply do not see how skinny i am sure some days or weirdly mornings morning skinny iykyk i feel quite ok about my body but that feeling quickly wears off esp after i eat or see myself from a bad angle a few days ago i stepped on the scale and saw the number which was lower from last week at that moment i told myself that this is the moment from which i am going to stop counting cals and macros and start eating enough well guess what happened i overate for 4 days and i am back at counting i am so not proud of myself i am so not proud of the fact that i am fully aware of what effect undereating has on a body and mind yet i just can not nourish myself correctly i tried i really did but it feels impossible i hope that sometime in the future i gain the strenght to seek help and chose recovery,1,390
i hate hearing people talk about my ed somebody was offering me a donut and i declined just because i do not like donuts but then my friend butts in and says oh well she does not eat anything anyways which i have been trying to recover for a year now so i do not know what provoked her but it is just making me upset to think about am i sensitive i am just so appalled like who says that,1,81

would you consider this sabotage long story short my childhood bff made a comment about my weight i was recently diagnosed with a progressive illness and i am starting the treatment next month during all the process which took seventeen to eighteen months i was able to change my eating habits and lost a great amount of weight that i had gained after recovery now i am in a healthy weight and i did relapse and began restricting again the doctors mentioned to me multiple times that gaining weight would only make my illness worse so maintaining it below sixty kg is a must i explained this to my friend before but she made the comment now that you have a diagnosis you can gain your healthy weight back the healthy weight she is talking about is not healthy i was overweight and facing many health issues and i am not going back to that i made sure to explain all the reasons why i could not and would not go back to that weight but she got upset and said it is just an advice but i feel like she is upset i am no longer obese nor overweight she is obese just to make it clear and no i am not making fun of that i am mentioning it to add context and criticizes my eating habits and says that i am too thin when i am not even underweight i do believe she is trying to sabotage me but also what if she is just concerned or is suspecting i relapsed i do not know i am still angry she made that comment about my weight,1,279
i think this was the because of my ed has anyone experienced anything similar to this i started getting into c ke some time last year and i was doing it pretty much every day amp the day i realized that i lost a significant amount of weight was when my roommate said have you been eating and realistically i was not really i did not have an appetite at that point i would only eat when he would split food with me and he started doing that because he noticed i was not eating for context 26f i could not even identify my symptoms as ed symptoms or drug abuse symptoms i was always a mid sized girl so being able to feel my hip bones and collar bones for the first time was an insane feeling eventually i stopped doing drugs because it got to a point where i could not burp had acid reflux and i would basically start gagging myself to force a burp i was on a diet of gingerale and cigarettes because my stomach could not handle anything else and eventually i started feeling better but then the weight started piling on i tried everything to avoid gaining weight all i could think was what was the formula i started to realize the only thing that would supress my appetite was c ke so now year and some change later i start doing it again any time i feel like i eat too much and in my head i cannot shake the idea that if i stop this ill gain weight again i do not wish this on fucking anybody i do not even enjoy the feeling off it i just enjoy the fact that i cannot eat on it even if i do eat on it i shit immediately after its like my metabolism is working on 1000 i wish i never picked it up when i do not have it i will eat 1 thing and i am like omg i gained fucking 5 pounds from eating this i need c ke so i can stop eating it is truly the worst thing i could have ever picked up but i cannot help feeling so good when i look in the mirror,1,380
tw greif just need to get this out there is noone in my personal life i feel comfortable sharing this with but this subreddit has always seemed really supportive my partner was in hospital that was far away it was serious but he was getting better he told me that when he came home he would come back with a ring for me days later i got a call saying he had taken a turn for the worst he died that night i was too depressed to starve myself i was too depressed to think about doing anything which i suppose included eating because i got really thin really fast i would always been an average weight before that except for the time i had late stage sepsis as a kid i did not think about it though one day i weighed myself because i noticed bones more and realised i would gotten below my ugw i have a new partner now and i am getting better recently i have reached the weight i was at before my fiance died now the grief is all flooding back i did not realise but being underweight was my badge the sign that i was forever changed from the loss it is gone it sounds so daft and i am hoping it does not affect my recovery too much i have been doing well i am just having a bad time because awfultune things that i miss came on i love my partner now just as much as i do my late fiance i am going to focus on that but it is hard sometimes i definitely need therapy huh anyway thanks for reading,1,281
i miss being skinny i am weight restored and a year into recovery i took it too far i was emaciated to the point of death this is not a fucking brag it was honestly the scariest loneliest and most miserable experience i ended up in the hospital for 3 months and ever since then i cannot starve myself anymore i binge if i even mildly attempt too i hate having a belly i hate having thighs i hate having flabby arms i just want to be thin again i think i am triggered because i binged out of nowhere i was two weeks clean and then i just wanted a few chips and all of a sudden i am nauseous from the amount i ate like what the fuck do i do i do not want to be boney every again that is suicidal mania but i cannot stand being a normal size i do not want to starve my way there but i also am impatient when it comes to healthy dieting i miss the attention i got i miss feeling like a gem there is something about being a dainty beauty that is euphoric and only attainable with the poise of thinness i have had 5 years of therapy i am not doing it for the control or male gaze or my childhood bullies or the conventional beauty standard i like feeling that way it is so damn freeing i felt liberated fat weighs me down i do not feel like it is apart of me it is an appendage that should not be there when it is muscle and bone that makes sense that feels right i think i am finally going to commit to a meal plan not extreme starvation and regulated work outs i am done feeling like a mess i want that poise,1,310
aging with an ed i am so sick of the whole myth that you pack on a lot of weight once you hit 18 and that your body changes forever okay i have only just recently entered this chapter of my life but ever since i was like a little girl i heard older women including my mother telling me that my body will age and be fat and that it is going to be a bitch to stay hot or whatever and looking back not only does it sound insane but also very much like internalized sexism but mainly its completely fake if somebody is reading this you do not have an expiration date and it was important for me to post this on this thread as a person with an ed because i know how i can fear gaining weight and i can only imagine others feel that same way too and while my body will not look this youthful forever it is insane to tell teenagers and 20 year old girls women that they are damage good the moment they hit 18 also kind of feel like pedophilia i do not know whatever if somebody is reading this do not binge or fear a recovery whichever step you feel you are at right now by justifying it with the excuse that it does not matter because you are going to age anyway,1,235
iced coffee so i have found that i do not really care about the calories in iced coffee and will not count them it is like a safe food i guess it is a drink that just keeps me going even though i know that i get a lot of stuff in it i just do not care coffee will not hurt me so i was just wondering if anyone else had anything similar like that also kind of off topic but any good suggestion of snacks i want to try as many as possible stay safe you all,1,99

trying hard to not relapse for a tattoo artist photo i am 2 years out of recovery and i have weighed the highest i have ever been and to be honest not even in a disordered way i hate the way i look and feel and have a hard time taking any pictures of myself that are not of my neck and up recently i got a leg tattoo on my knee and the artist is amazing and a really nice guy and he told me to come back in once it is healed so he can take a picture of it his instagram page is quite large one of the biggest in my city for tattoo artists and i lot of my old mutuals and classmates happen to follow him and as much as i want to be able to support him and his amazing work and career i am finding it incredibly difficult and anxiety inducing to even imagine my fat leg being the focus of a picture for thousands of friends and old bullies to see has anyone else experienced something similar how did you get through it,1,191
low intake severely affecting my work life hi sorry for posting again i hope this is not considered spam will not post again today my intake is max gt  400  lt and it is severely affecting my job but i genuinely cannot go higher than that i cannot bring myself to do it my brain is so scrambled that sometimes i will be talking to my coworkers and i just completely lose my brain for a second my train of thought is just gone and i cannot think i work as a food runner on a 4 acre property so i am really struggling does anyone have any vitamin supplement recs that can help or do i have no choice but to up my intake,1,125
referred for an assessment i called a hotline the other night and admitted i guess for the first time that i think i am too fat to eat the lady on the phone used the eating disorder word and it just turned me off of the whole thing i do not think i have an eating disorder or that i have earned it yet i am aware that this is basic eating disorder thinking i think i am scared that i normal bmi history of bulimia behaviors will get diagnosed with bulimia or ednos or atypical anorexia not asking for a diagnosis but i guess someone else who understands that it is just so insane i would prefer to ruin my grades lose my job and drop dead from abusing my heart with stimulants and depressants while restricting than get a label on my head that i do not like i hate how out of control this has been it felt the same many bmi points ago though so i cannot be done yet i do not like that i feel trapped watching myself kill myself with no way to stop the assessment place called today and i did not pick up i have been in and out of the er for my physical symptoms and after getting fluids they clear me to follow up with my gp so i just feel like i need to keep going and lose faster i really do not know what i am going to do i just cannot talk about it or eat more and i am definitely not sick enough for a day program or anything the more options on my plate tell my gp go to the er get an assessment try to find an ed therapist the more i think about killing myself because i do not deserve help and i am sure they will agree the hotline lady said we can tell when you are not eating but nobody has noticed so i must be eating too much,1,339

college changes everything being in college has changed everything about my ed for better or for worse before college i struggled really bad with bed and bn and my first year of school being on campus and everything i noticed i gained a little because i was so happy and drinking a lot lol but i was not purging and that was a great step now in my second year i live away from campus and meals are almost entirely on my own regard this has changed my habits quite a bit before i would have trouble not being able to control what i eat now with having a job and lots of things to pay for it seems like food is the last thing on my mind and the least important budget wise it is really hard for me to actually buy food because i am such a penny pincher and i think it has turned my ed in the opposite way when i noticed i was not spending so much on food and i started to get incredibly busy with school my mom mentioned my weight when i saw her again it did not really well kind of cross my mind until she said that but now i am being ultra conscious about maintaining that it is horrible and very disordered but once she said that she noticed a difference it has kind of enabled me to keep up the same behaviors my mom has always been a sort of perpetrator in my ed behaviors and now only seeing her every so often it starts to feel like i am competing with my past self how do i manage a busy and broke life while also paying attention to my physical needs i am trying not to fall back into ill patterns but it gets sort of impossible when you are in charge of your finances,1,318
the hardest part of trying to recover is trying to convince yourself that eating more is worth it where is the balance between a normal meal and binging why do i always have to eat so much to the point i feel sick just let me find a balance between binge and restrict please,1,54
as a late 20s person who told themselves they would start taking pictures and living life when they got thin and then it never happens if anything you gain and having pictures taken of you gets so bad you cannot even take them of yourself in your best lights and angles anymore you are scared to even look in the mirror now and avoid it when you go in public bathrooms you dread glancing up and having your worst fears of looking hideous be true but then sometimes you do look up and you are kind of surprised you do not look that bad but then you start picking at the things you see wrong you have restricted on and off for years and years and it never sticks sometimes it feels like eating is the only bit of pleasure you get out of life time is running out for you to be hot and have a glowup sometimes you think people are talking behind your back about how you are kind of chubby and yet they compliment you to your face but they are lying you go on social media and envy girls that can put a camera down and stand away from it and show their whole body and are happy with it they can show it entirely without having to hide certain parts it is not even about looking fat in clothes anymore you feel disgusting and frumpy in everything you feel rolls under your clothes that may or may not be there you constantly search for new clothes to feel good in but the problem is you you might look like that girl you want to be on the outside but you will never know because you cannot see it you will never enjoy your youth you will constantly strive to look like someone else you will only like photos from the past where you realise you looked thin back then but did not realise it but now you are fat and the cycle continues you have not worn a short sleeve shirt in years edit in honour of you guys and for myself i am going to try to wear short sleeves and shorts this summer it complicates it having scars but i cannot hide forever,1,381
i thought i would be fine because i was not purging often i have only been purging super rarely and i knew it would still be damaging but i figured it would not be this bad before i started purging again all my teeth were still perfect just got 3 fillings and i might have to get 2 more dentist said if one of them had been any deeper i might have needed a root canal lol plus apparently i have some discoloration on my back teeth luckily not visible all within the past year since i started purging again i only told them i had reflux so i kept getting comments about how my teeth seemed extra prone to decay for some reason i feel so stupid why could not i have just not done this to myself,1,139
bestfriend with an ed i hate it i hate eating around my friend who has an eating disorder i feel so guilty and honestly i feel like she is made me be more afraid of food i do not know if i will ever recover to be honest,1,48
i hate going to family parties so on my dads side of the family i absolutely hate going to family parties because there are four people including myself who had or have eating disorders it is my cousin who was bulimic and then my aunt s mil and sil who are both anorexic and there is me the sister in law i am pretty sure knows about it but nobody else does i am always really careful so nobody knows and i think too it is because like for me i can fairly easily spot others with eds so i worry it is the same for them in two weeks i have to go to one and i am already stressed,1,121
feeling invalidated i struggled with disordered eating when i was in college things have improved and i am 25 now and have recently put on some weight have always been underweight and praised for it now i am at a healthy weight i recently started going to the gym consistently for the first time since college and quickly started to become veryyy conscious of my body my original goal was to feel stronger and gain stamina and now i am just preoccupied with being skinny again i have been skipping meals counting calories all that jazz for the last couple of weeks i decided to tell my boyfriend today that i feel like i am slipping after he made a comment about my dinner having too many carbs i did not end up eating it lol he is very much a gym rat and used to be overweight when he was younger but was able to lose and maintain in a healthy way he pretty much said that it is normal to dislike my body and want it to look better and that there are healthy ways i can go about counting calories ooooooooof i know he means well but it just turned into a lecture about protein and macros and how we should go to the gym together to work on our goals i tried to explain the way that my brain works but he just did not get it at all all i wanted was his support and to let him in on something he said that was triggering to me but the whole conversation just triggered me even more he is literally the love of my life and such a supportive partner otherwise i think he just genuinely does not understand this is mainly just a vent but if anyone has any good educational resources i will gladly accept mwah,1,313
just really struggling not to relapse right now and feeling very triggered tw suicidal ideation assault weight really really struggling not to purge or take a laxative right now honestly i have not purged in a little over a month now just got off the phone where i got into an argument with my parents they are literally oceans away and there is only one concern on their mind my weight not that i am constantly in pain and i am positive i have endometriosis and have been trying to figure that out with docs all by myself not that my depression is so horrible not that there ve been days when i wanted to gt  self yeet  lt not anymore do not send the reddit notification thing please not that i was gt  raped  lt literally just a lil over a year ago and they do not even know shit that happened that i have ptsd i have an emdr therapist a psychiatrist a counsellor on campus and a third freaking counsellor for the random bullshit with roommates they do not know anything just weight weight weight weight all the fucking time i wish i could cut off my stomach and my thighs and my arms and just be a teeny tiny gt  90 lbs  lt girl but no i am a fucking gt  200 lbs  lt dumb fatass gorilla,1,231
got a new meal plan it is more restrictive than what i ate before so i went for some tests today turns out my body hates me so much that it is decided to slow my metabolism down to a measly bmr of gt  1020  lt calories day at 17y o i guess i had it coming but it still sucks anyway the hospital put me on a gt  1200  lt kcal meal plan which i absolutely fucking hate i was not eating enough before but at least i was eating foods i liked now i am eating little and i am eating foods which are either fear foods or foods i genuinely do not like i do not know where i am going with this post i guess i just need to vent out my frustration sorry i just feel like this will not lead to anything but further obsessive control over what i eat other than absolutely fucking me over in the head been snappy and crying ever since i got back from the hospital and food looks like the worst thing on earth right now,1,188
people say i purposefully abstain from eating to maintain my slim body not true i started to eat less and less because i became very introverted at home and stopped leaving my room i just did not want to interact with anyone and my appetite was not too big ever slowly i think my stomach became unable to take in a lot and now i am just used to eating less but i am trying to eat more i do not do it because of a lifestyle or to maintain my physique or whatever apparently anorexia nervosa means you are scared of gaining weight well i am not i want to gain weight and my father is a doctor even though an opthalmologist but he says i have anorexia nervosa which pisses me off because my perception is clear i want to gain weight but i just cannot seem to i have a gt  15 8  lt bmi which means i am severely underweight and i have heard some stories the saddest part is my brain seems to have a diminished capability of staying on a task i wonder if the weightloss is a culprit,1,195

i had a meltdown over ants my ed and health is not great at the moment and i guess i am struggling with the control aspect last night i opened my cupboard and there were like 10 tiny ants around the lid of a cordial bottle i was like ffs why are there ants my house is clean and i just cleaned that area last week i do not know how they got in and i could not see a trail or gap where they came from my bf said they are just ants but i do not leave food or crumbs out i do not cook so there is no residue when he left the kitchen i started clearing out the cupboard and i was crying like big tears over effing ants he must have thought i am insane now i have got the entire contents of my cupboard over my kitchen counter and i emptied a whole container of ant dust over the shelves and windowsill so i have to clean it all up today when i got into bed i said i am sorry for crying over ants and he said it is not that clearly it is the other stuff going on i started ranting about them again and he said quote you have got bigger things to worry about than ants valid anyway you can pretend nothing is wrong but you might end up crying over ants,1,242
scared to eat something i do not know the calories of i am going on a solo date to the cinema tomorrow the plan is to fast all day until after the movie then let myself eat something nice for once but the old burger place i used to order from does not have calories on the menu and i am too afraid to eat there in fact any food that does not come up on my cronometer i simply will not eat i know practically this one meal will not make me gain weight but not knowing the exact calories is so anxiety inducing i do not know if i am looking for advice i am just sad that things have gotten to this point afraid of a damn burger,1,131
how do i handle it when my mother makes severely critical comments on my body i bought some new jeans today and she immediately tells me they look bad and too large on me understandably i get upset and she launches into another tirade about how i am lying pos too skinny gross etc and she does not want me to do anything for her ever again i know she does this to be as mean as possible but how do i just   let it roll off my back it is so mean and i feel terrible i always walk on eggshells around her and this house is a nightmare to live in i live in fear daily,1,118

have not made a bm in 2 weeks or more i know this is tmi i was thinking about this yesterday but forgot to post scrolling through my reddit home feed reminded me to post today it is been so long since i made a bm too long maybe more than 2 weeks but i am not sure exactly time is kind of a blur right now definitely more than 8 days though i drink a lot of water and i have been drinking one water bottle with restorolax in it a day to try and help move things along but nothing i have taken laxatives on 3 separate days too i do not abuse laxatives i just take them when i am painfully constipated and cannot go as intended so i have been trying to use laxative because i have not been able to go on my own day 1 took a laxative usually these ones take 6 12 hours for me so i waited business as usual day 2 still nothing so i waited and waited the end of the day comes around and still nothing i thought okay maybe tomorrow morning day 3 morning comes around and nothing happens in the afternoon i took another laxative day 4 still nothing not even a smidge of an urge waited it out day 5 another laxative day 6 today same thing nothing what is going onnnnnnnnnnnn on a schedule day i go maybe once every few days but never like this i also feel so heavy not necessarily constipated either just heavy in the stomach region cannot quite explain it ugh any suggestions on what to do now,1,279
being a painfully average weight while struggling with eds it is just so embarrassing obviously i know that a lot of people who struggle with eds are not underweight but that does not stop me from feeling soo invalidated like no one would look at me and think i have a problem my body looks completely normal a bit chubby even but i still freak out over the calories of vegetables i still lost my period and am freezing all the time and everything i think about is food and it is been more than five years and i have never been skinny i am just suffering with nothing to show for it lol nobody knows what i am going through and it is just terrible the amount of jealousy i feel looking at other people s post is insane but the guilt is even worse i should not hope to be like that but i do and i am an adult my ed started when i was 20 but i never actually got to a point were people would worry about me part of me just has this desperate need to be taken care of and another part is just completely in denial because how bad can it be when i still have stomach rolls and thick thighs and do not look like a skeleton i hate this i wish i looked sick so it would actually be believable that i have a disorder,1,245
the state of my hair i feel like i have a solid 4 strands of hair at this point lol i did it to myself whatever whatever but it is so horrible even worse because i used to get compliments on my hair all the time because it was so thick and nice now i lose clumps just touching it,1,60
i love finding one recipe that is cal friendly and very filling i do not want to post my recipe because of the rules but i just wanted to share how excited i am about this dumb salad it is not low cal but it is protein heavy and all greens super tasy and very filling and i can have lots of it and i do not feel awful just celebrating little victories where eating does not make me feel like crap,1,82
wow one of my aunts just posted a video with my cousin in it and all i can say is wow my cousin is extremely gorgeous and she is the beauty standard she is only a couple months older than me and i cannot just forget about the video i have been comparing her body to mine and i cannot stop,1,61
clothes do not fit me anymore and it makes me feel so insecure so i am extremely tall and underweight and nothing fits me it is always either way too short or extremely baggy in a bad way and as a fashion lover it makes me feel so bad and insecure anyone else who has this problem have you found something that does fit,1,64
why do i feel comfort in being over full i have been under eating for a while now and i have successfully been able to keep that up because i live with my boyfriend and having someone around helps me to be mindful of my eating well he is home for a while and i have been slipping back into my old habits of eating to a point of discomfort of stomach pains and feeling like i cannot move something about this state is so comforting and appalling i do not understand why i have been feeling good restricting my food intake and seeing results and now i just feel out of control,1,113
health issues tw discussion of effects of disordered eating i got back test results from the doctor today and unfortunately i am malnourished they think i need help i am getting worse not diagnosed and i cannot stop and my therapy is so focused on something big going on my life we do not have time to talk about this i just need self help or resources something anything my health is taking a toll even with me having added vitamins and electrolytes to my diet i have tried to see a dietician to get on a healthy diet plan but my insurance will not cover them i am aware enough to realize i should be worried what can i do to reduce harm,1,124
i am quitting my meds this is kind of a vent asking for advice or opinions from anyone who is been on ssris before trigger warning for weight talk but it is all censored i started prozac in august last year for anxiety and depression and experienced the typical initial weight loss and then intense weight gain i went from gt  103 lbs bmi low 19s  lt to gt  118 lbs bmi high 21s  lt for context i am just shy of 5 2 i have been weight restored from an r for about a year now i was still recovering when i started medication i have tried really hard to accept my body at this weight especially because prozac has truly made me much happier but the appetite increase my diet has changed and i have trouble controlling my cravings which is very out of character for me because i have always been extremely disciplined and headstrong in all areas of life coupled with weight gain body changes the fat composition the fact that i cannot work out the way i used to it is all taking a toll and i do not think being on these pills is helping me as much as it is hurting my self esteem i have never felt less attractive and i know that is not true because everyone tells me i am gorgeous but i do not believe them and i used to i miss when i did i am on an extremely low dose the standard starting point so i cannot imagine withdrawal will be too bad especially since i have not been on them for even a year now i will not tell my doctor because i am not at a point where i think my mother would be okay with this decision especially since i worked hard to convince her to put me on meds in the first place but i need to try to live life without them just to see if it helps,1,336
i lost all my relationships for this almost all my relationship had been ruined because i was so bad with my ed or because that person because me more harm than good beeing ill and depressed and been in recovery has made me so alone i am in my 20s and i am more alone than ever i know that the 20 are hard and lonely but i always had so much difficulties for having an ed and beeing depressed for all my teens and part of my 20s and now i do not know how to meet and make new friends i do not know,1,106
i used to obsess over food and now i have no desire to eat at all i f19 have had a restrictive ed since i was about 13 i was formally diagnosed with an when i was 16 but i still do not know if i fully agree with this diagnosis i was never given any treatment for it by the way i used to obsess over food what i could eat when i could eat it how much i would spend do kuch time watching food videos cooking savoring every bite i allowed myself then feeling overwhelming guilt and embarrassment over my enjoyment of eating i know this is very common in those with eds i have been through periods where i was less restrictive or restrictive in different ways mt ed has definitely behaved differently at different points in my life now i do not know what happened but l no longer have that same obsession like because of university i have been eating less than i have been in a while but i cannot seem to care it is like thinking about food and eating has finally lost its appeal and i am just sick of it the problem now is that it is caused me to avoid eating too much thar i feel tired dizzy weak and when i try to eat my stomach hurts and i cannot bring myself to want to eat either i do not know what happened or why maybe my mind just gave up can anyone else relate to this i just feel really tired and confused right now and i want to feel less alone,1,275
calories are always on my mind it is the only thing i ever think about when going out i cannot enjoy any type of food or have a meal out with family because i am so worried about the calories and gaining weight even if i do eat a meal all i can think about is the calories and i always feel so guilty,1,64
any thoughts on oa overeaters anonymous recently found that there is some oa groups in my country and thought on checking one out my ed has been getting worse lately and i cannot nor really want to reach out to an actual professional about it and it looks like something that could help but i have never seen anyone on ed subs talk about it so i am worried tldr anyone got an experience with or opinions on oa,1,79

clogged toilet the toilet at home is clogged and i am pretty sure it is my fault i often wrap some food in napkins and throw it there and never had a problem until now what do i do when my father tries to fix it will he find yk,1,50
i am sad i just had an appointment where i spoke to a psych regarding re entry into their ed program i had done their outpatient program last year and unfortunately did not show much improvement and have not been doing well anyways today she was assessing me again to see if it was worth it for me to try again only after a ton of pressure from my family doc i explained to her what i did in outpatient last year and the tools i had learned to which she replied well i think you pretty much tanked after treatment immediately this statement was hurtful yes i know i did not do well and there are soo many professional ways of saying this but to flat out say i failed treatment lacks so much empathy i am a human with a heart and soul not just some case number on a wait list dehumanizing so all the effort that i put in doing the homework coming in twice a week filling out daily food logs commuting via bus and 3 trains means absolutely nothing like i put the hard work in i am literally in tears right now am i really that worthless by the way the outpatient i did last year was my first ever time doing treatment for an ed also it is public healthcare since i cannot afford private,1,233
residential ugh why am i have a panic attack about going to residential this is not my first time but the panic attacks will not stop ugh,1,27
can someone tell me if i am majorly underweight uw enough for my doctor to bring up recovery tw weight numbers i have never talked to my family or my doctor about my ed but it is been really bad lately and my mom has been mentioning it a lot and when seeing a nurse the other day she mentioned my weight loss as well i have to see my doctor in a little over a month and i am worried about what she is going to say when i go in it is for a physical so even more so i do not know if i am allowed to ask this but i am gt  18 5 6 and about 99 101 pounds  lt is this concern enough for her to bring up an ed sending me somewhere getting recovery support also since i am 18 she will not say anything to my mom right i really do not want to gain weight especially since it is summer time but i do not want issues to be brought up either,1,181
regretting recovery i have been in recovery for almost 9 months and i hate how recovery has made me i have restored all the weight i have lost and then some it is made me very insecure so much so i have anxiety of how people perceive me now in my bigger body my mom has tried to assure me that things will shift but what if it does not i feel like i have been failed by the recovery process in a way because yes i have recovered to a healthy body but i do not feel recovered mentally i know that where i was at before recovery was not healthy in the slightest i was hospitalized and had to miss my senior year of college so i can go into treatment but i am also very depressed with where i am at now i am now walking on this tightrope with watching what i eat and exercising while trying not to full blown relapse i wish i was like those recovery accounts on social media they have seem to be recovered while maintaining their smaller frame,1,188
has anyone managed to maintain their ugw i want to practice some harm reduction by maintaining my weight as of right now it is pretty low and i was wondering if it is possible i know the health complications will still be there but i just want to stop losing for now any ideas on how i can do this,1,60
how do i stop an unintentionally harmful headspace i have been in recovery for almost a year and i really thought i was getting better but recently i found some photo s of myself a year and a half ago when i weighed gt  under 50kg  lt and i started comparing myself in those photos to how i look now and even though i do not want to relapse into those old habits i have subconsciously been eating less and weighing myself more i really do not want it to get any worse because i was so miserable when i had an ed but i have started feeling sick at the thought of eating and i keep thinking of comments that have been made on my appearance recently and i just do not know how to stay in my recovery mindset anymore,1,142
struggling with the idea of gaining weight i was gt  47  lt kg at my lowest i miss being that light now i have gained gt  10  lt fucking kilograms this puts me at a bmi of nearly gt  20  lt which i know is supposed to be good but still i miss being lighter i wish i could be shorter so i would not have to weight this much i know i need to keep recovering if i want my body to keep growing properly but gaining weight is just so so painful i am currently going through my second estrogenic puberty on hrt i need to eat if i want my body to grow properly otherwise i will risk permanently fucking up my growth i hate it i just want to be able to grow without gaining weight how can i overcome my fear of weight,1,148
hey chat how do i stop feeling ugly in recovery i genuinely never take note of this in other people but god for myself it is insufferable i gained a lot of weight in recovery and i just look at old pics and obviously compare my body but even my face i feel i was so pretty and attractive and i hate what i look like now in most pictures i might sound dramatic but it feels like grieving knowing i could never possibly have that body back without making myself sick and even then i might not be able to because i am older and restriction just does not work the same lmfao i also know i did not feel good about myself deep in ed but it is so easy to forget about all that anyway fuck the world and beauty standards and fatphobia i fucking hate how deeply engrained it is in my brain like go away please,1,161
will my face go back to how it looked pre recovery i am 18 now and i have recently started recovery and am uw currently the last time i was at a healthy weight was at age 14 but my face was really chubby for my weight and it is not body dysmorphia because other people have said the same this makes me think my fat distribution to my face is genetic and it is kind of putting me off recovery because i really do not like how i looked back then i only now look my age because the fat made me look significantly younger than my peers which i also do not want,1,115

is there any way to get better i do not know if i am disordered or something but ik for sure this pattern is not healthy at all ever since i have had this eating pattern it is fucking my relationship with anyone including myself i am currently living in a household where i have no choice but to eat out of respect and gratefulness i grew up poor so i have to be grateful for anything my friends always love to eat cannot blame them but they are not comfortable eating when one of us usually me does not want to eat i feel obligated to join every time because they are so so so genuine with trying to keep me healthy and it is fucking up my progress so much i tried to keep myself at home going out with them less when there is no classes so that i will not have to join them when eating but that just means i am at home most of the time which makes me binge even more i do not know where to put myself in this situation anymore i want to get better i am trying to get better but with this situation that i am in where i have little to no control over the food that is offered to me i doubt i will be able to make any progress at all ironically i am getting even worse because every time people ask me to eat or offer me food there will be a thought in the back of my mind saying that they are making me fat every time i eat with someone who looks thinner than me i lose the very little appetite i have every time i am in school or just outside i always look at people s cenrtain body part and compare it to mine for the rest of the day the list goes on i am not like this before when i was letting this eating habit consume me but now that i am trying to get better my mind decided that i should be worse than i already am,1,360

eds and ocd is anyone else s sickness fueled by obsessive thoughts beyond directly food related circumstances earlier i was coming back from my lunch break and on the drive to work had not touched the food yet witnessed an accident on the street and led to a spiral where i cannot touch the food now it is hard to logically put into words with the magical thinking and i know logically it does not make any sense but my brain immediately feels like the weight is on me to type out if i do not eat i can restore order to the universe at least for a moment feels absurd but it is just what i know to be true i guess this is just a rant sometimes the cruelty i am forced to bear witness to leaves me feeling so helpless and i begin to feel like my suffering is the only way to help like if i take from myself maybe it can go somewhere else that needs the help more than i do which if i think about for too long i realize it is more self serving than anything else i feel way too old to still be doing this the thoughts feel childish to me i just cannot always figure out how to drag myself out of the hole because i know the truth i just do not feel it,1,236
unintentional weight loss is going to make me relapse i was already recovered but in the past few months i have lost a significant amount of weight unintentionally i have already been speaking about it with doctors and they are planning to put me on a different adhd med that will give me more appetite i realized i was really scared of that and i do not want to be put on it i have been fixating recently on how my clothes have started to fall off my body and how bony i am i felt really uneasy about it at first and kind of scared but now i have been leaning into it and bodychecking and i am realizing i am kind of fucked lol i guess i am just posting cuz i have no idea what to do,1,140

i am an awful friend a couple weeks ago my friend said he was hosting a potluck it was supposed to be this wednesday i agreed to go initially because i could not think of any excuses but it was literally the last thing i wanted to do i am also autistic and hate socialising with random people by the time i got used to the idea of going he said it was cancelled because the venu was pre booked but he just texted to ask if i can rearrange to thursday i seriously cannot cope with plans changing especially when it involves food and strangers so i made up an excuse for why i would not go he is now very disappointed and said he only wanted to do it if i was there and i feel horrible but i just cannot do it now i am the worst friend this is really important to him and all i have to do is show up with some food and socialise but it is literally my idea of hell i cannot explain to him why i cannot go anymore though so he probably just thinks i do not care i push away anyone who tries to get to know me i do not know why he wants to be friends with me i have already let him down so many times i do not have the energy to keep up with friendships and i constantly lie to everybody now my urge to self isolate and sh are so much stronger i just want to rot in my bed and not eat anything without being distracted by having to keep up appearances i do not know how to cope with the guilt i do not deserve my friends and i just hurt them,1,302
does anyone elses ed evolve for us our ed has just continued to evolve like it started with atypical anorexia then we attended recovery kind of just binged for a couple months instead of actually recovering gained weight hated ourselves so we ended up relapsing but instead it turned into bulimia and now i would say its ednos eating disorder not other specified sometimes we binge some times we binge and purges some times we overexercise and sometimes we restrict and even if we eat normal we hate ourselves to be honest i feel like we had endos even before our atypical anorexia like we would go through periods of binging restricting and eating normal we are a did system which is why we used we instead of i sorry for any confusion,1,133
i cannot stop binging k this is one of those things where i say binging but actually it is the amount of calories most people eat per day but whatever let me vent recently i have been doing so so good with restricting i will not say the calories but pretty low i would eat pretty little every day and feel satiated and i just felt so good and in control but since last week and this week i just cannot i will eat good at first and then binge during the night where i just cannot control myself i have tried to up my daily calorie intake but i still binge ik it is probably because i have been restricting and now my bodies reacting to it but i just hate this so much i feel so disgusting and out of control,1,143

it is so tempting i am dealing with so many difficult things right now and it feels like the solution is to relapse the second anything in my life gets hard that is what i want to default to i want to feel numb and tired so i do not have to feel all the awful fucking emotions that are coming up for me i do not think it will ever be my time to be actually happy so i might as well do my version of it i do not know what to do i am not happy when i am disordered and i am not happy for an entirely different reason when i am recovered objectively it is so much better to be recovered but i just cannot convince myself i deserve it i know that if i stop eating i will lose my job i wish i could care right now i just feel like a burden,1,160

i always go it is just water weight until it happens to me when i gain x pounds unexpectedly i am sure it is 100 fat from eating thousands of calories i did not eat i know i am being irrational by thinking this i know it will go back down but i still spiral and it is so irrational and stupid but my brain cannot handle seeing these fucking numbers to make it worse i do not own a scale because harm reduction so i only weigh myself on weekends which is when i eat more and i know why i weighed more today than yesterday but i was kind of hoping my weight yesterday was also water weight so now i am doubling down on the it is just water weight thought which might be me lying to myself lol anyway i would love to not care about my weight but i am afraid that i will gain a billion kgs if i do not check it so,1,170
i have a physical in a little over a month and i feel like i need to gain weight for it i have lost a lot of weight since my general family doctor has seen me i went in for a shit the other day and it was just a nurse who did it but i got weighed and she mentioned my weight loss concerningly my mom has been very suspicious of my behaviors lately and has been getting on my ass about my weight loss too i have a physical in june and i really do not want anything bad to be brought up i am 18 so my mom will not be there but of course they can communicate things to her i am afraid of what my doctor will say if i go in at my current weight and i do not want to deal with all that but this is the worst time i could start gaining weight summer and of course that is the opposite of what i want to do ugh i do not know,1,181
being skinny is like my asterisk i do not really know how else to explain it better than this but i feel that every time i picture my dream life or a life in which i might be satisfied or fulfill my goals i find myself still thinking but i need to be skinny too so for example i will think i want to have two cats and a dog work as a lawyer maybe get married and be financially stable but id also need to be thin and have a thigh gap my line of thinking always seems to only be positive if it involves being thin i just want to happy in my body but i am not and i do not think i ever will be and i am just angry i am reminded of this every time i look in the mirror or put on clothes why is being skinny my asterisk it is almost like i have anorexia s,1,164
how badly is my eating disorder going to affect my future please help a girl out i f19 initially developed bed in late 2020 early 2021 and only realised and accepted it by early 2022 i gained a significant amount of weight in three years and also purged occasionally i have been in recovery since october 2023 i still occasionally binge purge when under immense pressure and have dropped about 20 of the weight i gained am slowly working on dropping it all with time how badly will this affect my health in the future is there anything i can do to minimise this effect,1,105
i crave being full i hate how much i love the feeling of being overly full i do not like eating a small amount or a healthy amount i like the feelings of being very very hungry or being completely stuffed i hate that i enjoy the stomach ache after a disgustingly large meal i hate bed and i hate that i have a fear to even post this on a burner account on an anonymous subreddit i hate the embarrassment attached to having an eating disorder that does not solely involve starving i do not even want to fix this a huge omad is incredibly satisfying for me and it helps prevent me from thinking about food all the time since i know exactly when i will get to eat and i can eat as much as i want gahhhhhhhhhh food is so lame eating is so frustrating,1,149
wore a different style dress for the first time ended very badly at my dad s birthday dinner my grandma said wow you are really brave wearing that kind of dress since yes know you are a little bigger in the middle fuck you grandma and i was feeling awful because i had to attend my brother s wedding before the dinner and we had a massive lunch and i was told it would be disrespectful if i did not have any cake so i basically had a huge lunch and cake then went to a chinese restaurant and had to eat a normal sized meal there the wedding was a secret so i had to act like i did not just eat a huge lunch and cake and then eat my dad s birthday cake and grandpa s birthday cake they have close bdays so it was a combined birthday dinner then someone walked in on me while i was purging in the bathroom,1,165
my mom commented about me not needing to do anything to lose weight it hurts i am starving laughing out loud,1,21
i hate not being busy i am in nursing school and i am on break for the next 2 weeks it is pathetic but i am actually dreading being on break because i eat more when i am bored and when i am busy with school i am very good at restricting now i have nothing to keep me busy for 2 weeks how do you stay on track when you have nothing to keep your mind occupied part of me wants to get back into the gym but that can be a slippery slope for me just praying this break does not trigger a binge phase that takes ages to pull myself out of i am looking at you thanksgiving xmas break can anyone relate,1,126
do people not care about their stomachs or is mine just abnormal i have been very uw and healthy weight weight restored now and not a minimum bmi i am at my set point and no matter what weight i have been at my stomach always sticks out after i have eaten like first thing in the morning i am fine but as soon as i start to eat my belly gets bigger and i hate it i have no health problems that because it i have had it since i was a kid it is not as if i look pregnant or anything like that but any sort of bump in my stomach area i cannot stand like i will not dare wear a bodycon dress or high waisted pants with a crop top because i hate the little bump after i have eaten and feel like everyone is looking at it is it just my body type doing this or do other people have it and do not care i see loads of people wearing sports bra and shorts to the gym or tight dresses but i could never i have gained weight on my thighs bum arms all of which i can accept but i cannot accept my stomach after i have eaten which is a shame because my bf loves when i wear tight clothes,1,229
reaction to pain not seeking medical advice just wondering if other people have gotten this too ok so i was taking the bus the other day and the window next to me was open and it started raining so i closed it but i shut my fingers in the pain was not too bad and went away almost instantly but after about 20ish seconds my vision went black and i could not hear anything it took about 10 seconds to get those back and when i did i could hear a faint ringing and my vision was covered in a weird purple and white floral pattern that kind of looked like a wallpaper but i could see everything behind it does anyone else have weird reactions to minor injuries if you do feel free to share,1,136
control so this is my first post on any community of this nature so i am sorry if this is interpreted as me seeking medical advice nah my intentions are pretty much just to type this out and maybe hope someone knows the feeling and i am not just being a snowflake basically i have struggled with my body image for a while but more drastically the last year or two and this came on quite quickly too this period has involved me haphazardly diving into intermittent fasting when i was already underweight and basically just trying to feel like i have achieved something through restricting it is basically through a recent process this year that has made me think about why i get pushed to these extremes in the first place so i am 17 and in my country you can still be bulk billed or covered for medical service at this age but for wayyyyy longer than this i have been seeing doctors for pots or fainting i was never restricting so much that i was fainting when i first started this little medical journey at age 12 however as time went on the feeling of being weighed in an office with my mum gave me a weird satisfaction that i was underweight but at the same time a crushing guilt that i was just wasting my mother s time and effort with these things i feel like the reason i am like this is because i am so afraid of hurting my mum or going out into the real world like this so i go back to punishing myself and hiding in my little comfort zone my bed i feel like a lazy slob who is never had real family issues but i am still breaking inside a little whenever i am at these appointments only to know i will be letting her down by not improving my eating it is a very vicious cycle i want to feel weak in a weird way so i do not have to confront the world and all its systems but i hate myself for how i am constantly just someone who needs all this attention and helping,1,368

closet purge i was not ready for the emotions and the mourning of both my old body and my disorder i am still very mentally disordered but it is only bad when i have an intermittent relapse probably anywhere from a few weeks to three months at it is worst i have been in recovery for three years and throwing away my 00 clothes is painful and freeing at the same time i am too embarrassed to say what size i am now but it is definitely more average and i just perceive myself as much larger than the number on the scale or my pants i am hoping i am not the only one and someone else relates to this because i am currently sitting on my bed crying looking at a trash bag of old clothes from when i was 14 16 partially 17 but not entirely glad to have made it to 19 this year 20 is a really scary number to be going towards but i am alive i am physically healthy i am trying to feel better in my body again but exercising without focusing on numbers it is hard i am still really controlling but i am getting somewhere and i guess i am proud of myself sorry i know probably nobody will read this and it is mostly a vent with som happy sentimental stuff i just needed to put it out somewhere that feels safe,1,243

binging and bulimia vent i be been on the harm reduction path after my failed attempts at recovery with bulimia settling on a different schedule that is easier on my body and does not get to my brain much compared to what i have been at before for a while as my bulimia got worse my binges were so bad i would be tracking them estimating the lack of accuracy and raising a tracked binge at 2 000 to 3 000 to even 4 000 when i would continue to eat and purge and i know i have always had an over eating problem its always been a struggle i got down to a nice good weight and my binges only got worse and purges took longer taking an hour and a half to purge not even half of what i ate and still feeling the sense of wanting to eat again not even because of hunger but just for something i have been trying to fight my binge urges by binging on the most odd foods low calorie or even caloric but enough to keep me at a limit where i stop because i cannot eat anymore of that food because the taste has made me sick whole thing ofcanned beans that is one but its just terrible it sucks that its just the way the disorder is heading right now which its crazy that i have gone through waves where i accuse my self of faking this disorder taking ohotos of my purges and of my face and still telling my self in my brain that i am a fake and a liar and a wannabe but who wants this i do not want it and yet i cannot bring myself to ever talk about it because i know my family will say just do not eat and then turn around asn say eat its never enough and they cannot understand i have never been social so friends were never along with me to havenlost or gained i am not even worried eith work because my bosses are leniant and have even caught me right after i have left the bathroom froma second purge and just ask if i am okay and i say i am okay and that is that which its not even like my work likes that i have gotten so fat lately people saying i should learn to fast quietly to me in conversation of grabbing my stomach fat or smacking my butt its so weird but i try to keep the connections i have because i know in social situations i make things worse when i show i hate it i have done therapy and even they tell me they cannot help but offer a place to vent because i am too self aware i know where this obsession over weigght cane from and the food binging yet i cannot help my attitude with wanting to avoid medications because of past traumas my family had accused me of making up hallucinating when i was younger it just really sucks my twenties are filled with teeth slowly decaying digestion problems probably developing kidney pelvic floor problems i hate how being so odd so ovbiously out of the loop compared to other girls my age makes this suffering okay to my mind that i deserve to eat shit and feel shit because i cannot be happy like them because i cannot say the right things dress the right way be the right way like them my smiles never genuine the conversation sluring when i speak because i lose the words to say but know i need to give a response it just sucks and part of it feels i cannot move on without keeping the way i am disordered and fat but not as fat as i was before,1,644
need advice to stay in recovery going through a breakup right now 3 weeks in coming out of a 2 year relationship with the love of my life me and her are on decent terms now and we do plan to try again but we have to be separate it was messy at first and i started fasting again to help me clear my mind to ground me and admittedly to lose some of the weight i gained this past fall when i recovered when i recovered from my last relapse i gained about 15 pounds over the course of months and some of it was muscle and i am sure some was water i was fine with that until now i cannot stop fasting it used to be a choice and i used to break fasts with a good meal i do not really want to stop it feels too good it gives me control when everything else is out of control it is familiar and comforting when nothing else is it makes me feel confident when nothing else does it is what i learned to do whenever i feel like giving up or when i hate myself i do run to make me feel good too but unfortunately my only good coping mechanism is making me lose fat even faster but i do not want to be trapped i am scared what else can i do what else can ground me and make me feel confident what else can make me love myself i am almost at my lw again in just a few weeks because i have never fasted this much this easily and with this much pleasure at this rate there will not be much fat left soon to keep me going please can someone give me some advice i am not as obsessive as before but i feel it slipping i feel lost being single and this is the only part of identity i have known for so long that is not attached to anyone but me,1,342

relapsing vs having a life my ed started when i was youngg and had no responsibilities i was not even going to school everyday in back then and the most i would do was walk with my friend all day i never got to a dangerous weight but still felt some health issues all relating to being a little faint or b p related got hit with gerd some years later laughing out loud but symptoms were around early in my ed i even remember wishing i would faint or some shit lol i relapsed not too long ago and restricting while having shit to do feels like torment i have to stand all day at my job and walk for a long time to get to school and doing that while restricting is hell i have no idea how anybody does not rot in bed all day while having an ed i have on and off restricted for months at time for the past years but my life did not get busy until this year i cannot fast or else i will have the most horrific experiences ever if i eat even just a little under my bmr i will feel like blacking out every time i stand for a little too long all that on top of having to cook as well just 10 minutes of cooking makes me feel like blacking out and i lose my appetite but i need to eat in the first place for those issues to disappear all that is really helped has been raising my intake and eating healthy but i am getting to the point where it feels hopeless i have no idea how to control my health and its either b p or restrict for me and restricting is so much easier on my body than purging since i already have gerd i know i should start accepting that i need to recover but my dumbass is starting to think of ways do have less work to do but even worse i do not get a break until winter i guess i have just got to brace myself through it but i have spent so many years of my life telling myself that once i reach my gw i will get healthy lol this feels like an issue with the most obvious answer ever but i am not ready to consider recovering,1,402

fear of refeeding syndrome is holding me back in recovery beware this post will contain numbers i was eating gt  550 650 calories per day lt for a while i just started seeing an ed nutritionist last week and would like to begin recovery i upped my daily intake number to gt  750 850 calories per day  lt and have been trying to reach this everyday for the past week though it is been somewhat difficult this is my question    if i hypothetically had say gt  1000 calories  lt today could that put me at risk for re feeding syndrome or does it need to be a truly excessive jump i will say about 3 weeks ago i had gt  1500 calories  lt in one day and was okay but beside that i have been consistent in restricting otherwise it is a weird place to be in because half the time i feel like i am working hard to up my calories and the other half the time i feel like i am working hard not to up them too much and either way i am left feeling still restrictive i also think i am feeling extra hungry because i am supposed to be getting my period i have a fear of binging losing control and in order to prevent a binge want to give myself a little more food but again   afraid of re feeding syndrome anyone else plagued by this fear or could give me some encouragement any advice or insight is appreciated,1,255

a general rant so about a year ago i was obese i weighed around gt  242lbs  lt and over the course of a year i lost around gt  100lbs  lt i was praised constantly told how good i was doing and how good i look but like my body hurts so bad all i have the energy to do is lie in bed my knees hurt my back hurts the brain fog ugh it sucks but its like nothing anyone here probably has not experienced but people are still praising me i am trying to recover i am still in the healthy weight range but its so hard as i feel so invalid based on my weight and body i went to the doctor and they basically just told me eat more lmao but at the same time i do not really want to get better because i am worried about being overweight and all the baggage that came with that i used to be a legit binge eater i am talking huge quantities i cannot even put a number on it i cannot just enjoy food its always been something psychological for me a comfort or a weapon to punish myself with,1,203
i feel like i am not pretty enough to get away with being in a bigger body my mum took some pictures of me at easter as a keepsake and she hid them from me because she knows i am deeply insecure about my face anyways i was on her phone looking for a recipe and i saw the photos and i felt nauseous my cheeks were full and my arms were big it made my face even more unappealing i thought recovering meant i would come to peace with being in a bigger body but i do not think it will i see women with the same body type as mine with so much confidence and beauty i do not have like i have to be skinny because i cannot get away with being in my current body i feel like everyone around me does not hold the same respect they had for me when i was underweight over being in a healthy weight range does anyone have any advice for gaining confidence in themselves and how to style my curves i am trying to recover but it is so easy to fall back into restricting and wearing bigger sized clothes to conceal my weight,1,206
self conscious about what i eat does anyone else feel this way i swear everyone always talks about feeling embarrassed about people seeing them eat totally valid too do not get me wrong but for me it is about what i eat like if i tell someone that i ate and they ask what did you eat regardless of whether or not they know i struggle it makes me go ahhhh internally and i immediately have to come up with a response that feels less embarrassing and i have no idea why,1,92

what is something that is not a compliment but you are disordered brain takes it for one i think the most common one that i am sure many of you would relate with would have to be you look sick gt   you are bones are becoming more noticeable   lt or when i try old clothes from when i was obese and i get told that i look like a stick in it or when someone looks at my portions of food which seems massive in my head and ask me gt   are you really going to eat that little  you should have more   lt i know i should not take these as a compliment but i find it hard to hide my smile everytime i get one of these there are many more but i am curious to know what you guys have to say for this,1,147

i just wasted an entire day going to the store buying food then throwing it away seriously at this point i have a problem i went to the same store about three times today and spent about an hour each time just wondering around the store picking up things then putting them back until i finally decided on what to buy just end up throwing it all away in my building s trash on my way back to my dorm just to sit in my room and eat my usual meals of fruit and frozen cauliflower i had a pretty bad week not ed related and was trying to avoid purging so much since i recently got my wisdom teeth removed about a month ago and i am trying to avoid infections but today i ended up caving at the end of the day bought food to purge i ended up throwing the food away but forced myself to eat this organic vegan sugar free oatmeal which was actually very good but i felt so bloated since i literally spent the whole day exercising eating and looking at food i guess maybe it was a way for me to escape all the shitty stuff happening in my life i ended up feeling to bloated and guilty at the end of the day and ended up purging i did not purge everything because i have roommates and i did not want them to hear anything and they already suspect i have an ed but i just feel so guilty for wasting an entire day and so much money i hate spending money and all i spend money on is food to feed my stupid obsessions i hate myself and i want to blame all of this on my disorder but to be honest i am my disorder and i do not know who i am without it,1,316
admitting to ip in 3 days and i am full on panicking i am going inpatient at center for change on wednesday i am so fucking scared and i am regretting accepting the bed and i do not know if i can do this i do not want to be away from my husband i am so sad to leave work i also definitely do not feel sick enough or thin enough or any of that i want to call back and tell them i changed my mind,1,88
i just need to rant and nobody else gets it guess who is back i have been on and off this situationship with my ed for the last four years and i have come back because whenever i recover i feel like i am not myself anymore and everything feels so out of control i really do not get how people can just eat and not think about it because even when i was eating normally i felt like i was not eating enough or i was eating too much and it would still be in my head and it would be so overwhelming but when i am not focusing on it i feel like i can actually breathe and think about other things anyways i jumped from not eating to binge purge because when i would eat i would eat everything no exaggeration but i am guessing you guys understand and now i am the heaviest i have been and literally in the worst moods and health and all i want to do is go back to when i actually did not have it as part of my day and just did not eat and worry about it constantly i feel like a hit a limbo of my life where i just want the day to pass so i do not have to worry about the next meal and actually go to when i can think about something else anyway cute re entrance into this sub again,1,248
how do i protect my younger siblings from being influenced by my ed so i have been fairly open about my disordered practices but have made it abundantly clear to my younger siblings that i am doing it because i am sick and need a special diet to feel better some of them are too young so they think i eat and exercise the way i am for health reasons because i have a condition that they do not anyways i am constantly tracking the calories of what i eat and how much i am burning and so i will track it and i have a terrible habit of talking to myself when i work with numbers but i never speak about it to them the problem is that recently they have been saying stuff like let us play tag instead of restaurant running burns calories and restricting their portions sizes because they see me do it and it is scaring me the last thing i want them to do is have the same relationship with food and exercise i do especially at their age youngest is only 3 1 2,1,191
not feeling valid tw mention of weight no numbers so i developed an little over a month ago and i told my parents early on i am already starting recovery and i do not know if i have just been having good days or if i am genuinely starting to recover i still want to lose weight so bad but i am just so hungry and i want my favorite foods almond butter nuts and every time i eat them i usually eat the amounts of cals i am supposed eat in a day or more i have been eating more recently and i feel like i do not deserve to because i am not that underweight i just feel like everything is happening too fast and if i talked to someone else who is been going through this longer they would think i was not valid or i was faking which sometimes i am scared of too even if i am not faking i am just tired of being worried about this it feels like i have had an so long when it is only been a month,1,189

harm reduction tips hi trigger warning right off the bat i am still struggling and this may contain some triggering topics surrounding weight loss take care of yourselves i have been dealing with anorexia for more or less 5 years i have had long periods of recovery and semi recovery but last october i fell into a full blown relapse in march i started making steps toward recovery but the weight restoration happened quickly and has been absolutely horrifically terrifying and painful i am not at a point where i am comfortable going all in into recovery and i am still actively engaging in unhealthy behaviors calorie counting intermittent fasting unfortunately i just do not think i am at a place where i can accept the weight gain right now i really want it off but i do not want to do this in a way that will severely injure my body i know there will be a lot of comments encouraging me to push through this but right now what i would really like is harm reduction tips specifically on the mental side of things how can i lessen the obsessive thoughts about food how can i take steps toward a better relationship with food even if i am still engaging in ed behaviors i know that i will not ever achieve full food freedom and heal my relationship with my body until i go into recovery but right now the best i can do it try to take care of myself as much as i can and meet myself where i am at if that makes sense any tips advice is welcome thank you lt 3,1,278
does exercise really burn that many calories i used to over exercise i feel as it went on my body adjusted to the amount of movement and was not burning calories as efficiently is this a myth i have been recovering from my overexercising and have not exercised in almost 2 months still eating below maintenance gt    lt 1000cal    lt but i still have not lost the water weight that i suddenly gained at the beginning of recovery and my irrational brain is thinking that its fat i gained from lack of movement i truly think my metabolism is fucked help,1,101
intrusive thoughts about food challenges i watch a lot of food challenges like the gt  10k calories  lt challenge and sometimes i think to myself that i would like to try it and eat lots of stuff i would usually never touch and i wonder how well i would do most of these youtubers overestimate themselves and do not get close to it but that is mainly because of their food choices and the way they prepare their meals i think i could be smart about it but i am not a youtuber and there is no point in attempting this challenge if no ones watching laughing out loud like why put myself through this misery does anyone else sometimes think about what it would be like to do a challenge like this,1,133
does anyone else really want to gain weight but your ed will not let you i have been underweight for years now and i am so so tired of it everything hurts laying down sitting hell even cuddling my boyfriend hurts my ribs i constantly feel weak and useless clothes are hell because nothing fits and everything looks baggy and wrong i have to buy my jeans from the kid s section now and years ago in the beginning of my ed i might have felt some sort of sick accomplishment over that but i am 24 years old now and it is just embarrassing and shameful i am disgusting and boney my tits are long gone and my body looks like the body of sick 12 year old i am so ashamed of how i look and people always comment on it too so i know it is something that gets people s attention and that makes me not want to go outside and have anyone look at me i just want to look normal and have curves and have clothes fit and look good and look like an actual grown woman but i cannot every time i decide that i am done with this shit i only manage to gain like gt  2 3 kg  lt before the dysmorphia kicks in and i panic and start restricting again until i lose it again and then some always going just a little bit lower then before because somehow that weight does not feel skinny anymore and then i maintain for a bit until i start to absolutely loathe it again and i decide i want to gain weight and then the cycle repeats over and over i guess i just hate myself no matter what i weigh but then why cannot i just quit this if it does not matter i am so tired of this,1,317

i feel fucked up for being competitive i have been trying to recover and its going well but one of my classmates literally keeps reposting tiktoks about her ed and stuff ike how hard it is and it just makes me not want to recover i feel so fucking weird about it because i feel so competitive i know that like eds are usually really competitive but i feel like i am a bad person for wanting to be better than others or that i want to be sicker it does not help that i do not have the courage to tell anyone that i actually know i have only told two people but i do not want to inconvenience them by venting i feel so fucked up for having an ed,1,132
knocked over cookies in the grocery store and i feel fat because of it i do not know if it makes sense but whenever i make a fuss about food i feel so fat i do not know what other word to use let me know if other restrictors feel like this,1,52
i regret recovery sorry for another recovery sucks type post but i for real am having a hard time right now in the beginning recovery was great and all but now that i have gained i am starting to regret it all my clothes feel tight my stomach looks big again and i feel so uncontrollable with food i just feel miserable right now and so uncomfortable with my body i am also having to do this recovery all by myself so i just feel lost there is a part of me that wants to just relapse and lose all the weight again but i know it is not sustainable i also do not think i can physically restrict anymore i will probably just ramp up the exercise again because i have been pretty inactive during my recovery but even then exercise can only do so much when your diet is shit i stupidly might try to lose weight in a healthy way and hopefully not spiral again   i do not know i am just so unhappy with myself,1,179
is it weird i developed my ed as an adult i am 23 and i developed my ed behaviours last yr but i got diagnosed with atypical anorexia 2 months ago long story short i compared myself to how the other girls looked so pretty on my dance team lol i hear a lot of people developed theirs so young or during their teenage years my doctor was saying that its pretty common for young girls in their early 20s to develop it because of lifestyle changes maybe he is right i do not know i just feel really weird about it,1,102
question to the people that wear revealing clothes regardless of weight do you guys just push through the bdd and ed thoughts while wearing short shorts croptops tight pants etc or do you guys just not get them in that sense like ik a couple girls in real life who have really bad anorexia but even in recovery they would still opt for such clothes personally i have never understood it because i am the complete opposite type of person though i wish i was not lol so i would love to hear some perspective,1,95
i am recovering i am 16 i need to get over this before its too late i am so tired of thinking of food all the time and counting every single fucking thing i eat i want to be healthy and go to the gym and eat well balanced meals and not be scared when my mum offers me chocolate having 3 apples for breakfast is not normal having 4 protein yoghurts for dinner is embarrassing i am embarrassed of my eating habits my eating habits are shit and i am unhappy with myself and food so i am done i do not know if i am going all in i do not know if ill track macros for gains haha i do not know what this will look like but ik i do not want to count calories ever again and ik i do not want a meal plan i want to make yum sustainable healthy meals for myself and my family i want to care about getting enough protein and fats and everything my body needs while of course enjoying lollies every now and then i am probably going to leave this subreddit or stop being as active on it so goodbye for the most part and good luck to all of you all i hope you guys feel ready to recover soon it will be scary but it will be for the best  lt 3 by the way i made a list of reasons to recover and i want you guys to see them i stop thinking of food all the time i get my period back my heart will stop hurting i will not be cold all the time i will develop more of my social life i will have energy i will be strong food will not be an issue in the future i can prove to myself i am brave and can overcome things i can start going to pilates the gym i will stop noticing other peoples bodies so i will stop watching gross 2000s weight loss shows so i do not overspend and shitty artificial foods so i do not feel embarrassed when people see what i eat and i am going to think of more but i just woke up and decided this laughing out loud p i cannot wait to finally be free and feel good,1,396
recovery me and my mom were talking about my ed and i was crying saying i wanted to recover so bad then she mentioned how iconic it would be to recover on 420 and to be honest it does not sound like a bad idea or at least maintain,1,49
does anyone else try to hide their body because they are ashamed of their low weight i saw so many people commenting on another post that they like to show off their underweight body which made me wonder if i am the only one who is actually ashamed of it and trying to hide it,1,55
this ed sucks i think this eating disorder was made for people like me who deserve to suffer and never be happy never be comfortable the time i was happiest was at my lowest weight but i cannot say i was happy i was miserable living life my emotions were horrible but atleast i was comfortable with myself starving and having control over myself felt good and gave me purpose then i was forced to gain weight and my life fell apart i lost myself i am so depressed every day starts with a breakdown and ends with anxiety i ruined my relationship with my boyfriend everyone hates me and now i have zero control over myself stuck in a restrict all day then i force myself to stay awake as long as possible so i do not wake up and eat then i crash and wake up and binge then i am focused on losing the weight i have gained for 6 months i have been fluctuating trying so hard to lose the weight again then i binge and i gain it all back it is getting worse and worse i should have never reached out for help i should have been happy where i was at and suffered throught the medical problems i know i was on the brink of death but it was safer and happier there,1,230
veins why are my veins so prominent it is scary looking,1,11
where my ed started idek if i can call it an ed anymore i look normal but mentally i am still there but anywayssss i hope someone can relate and that i am not weird for this but when i was like 12 13 i found out about amy winehouse and i became so obsessed and wanted to be like her no idea why do not ask me eventually found out she had bulimia so what did i do ate as little as possible and whatever i did eat i threw up not at all fun and it was literally disgusting and not as glamorous as people made it seem but yeah lol it lasted for like a year and then i gained weight hit puberty late because i no longer purge yippee double weight gain also i lost my period for ages which at the time i thought was great but as time went on i got scared i would not be able to have kids which was not so fun um yeah anyway if anyone else gets overly obsessed with celebs then lmk because this still effects me to this day,1,193
4 20 note just here to say 4 20 cals do not count if it helps cals on me today have a good day everyone stay safe,1,27
ugh help i was trying to do better today i had two apples light and fight yogurt cup and a bunch of strawberries but then my boyfriend wanted to eat out so he ordered kfc we split the meal and i could not restrict because he was there so i had two biscuits a lil bit each of mac and cheese coleslaw mashed potatoes and a chicken breast it hit my stomach so hard and i could not purge while he was here i waited an hour so it did not seem weird and once he left i munched on ice cream and candy because i knew i was going to purge i did and now i just feel awful i do not feel like i am worthy of recovery it feels like once i eat anything i am just making it all up i see other people who eat so much less than i do and i feel so invalid like there is nothing wrong with me because i eat obv i know that is wrong but i cannot fight the thought that i am going to just gain and gain,1,192
i think my ed is turning into scoleciphobia and i am confused is it even considered an ed anymore i have had an ed for months now due to my body shape because of the desire to be thin and tiny at first it was a healthy weight loss process until i realized that my body shape is inverted triangle which made me get the desire to continue losing more and more just to become skinny but i recently found out that i have been infected by pinworms i could not sleep i kept going to the bathroom every 15 minutes to wash and the problem is my hygiene is pretty good i wash my hands before and after eating i change my underwear daily i wash every time i use the bathroom but all of that was not enough to protect me from pinworms my fear of food became even more extreme i always had a binge starve cycle but i feel so disgusted when i look at food i believed that i got pinworms from food since i live in an underdeveloped country and food regulations is not as good as developed countries my weight is not even my main focus to starve it is the intense fear of getting infected my pinworms i never felt disgusted of food when my ed was normal but now i do looking at food especially the food that i did not cook with my own hands disgusts me i can never bring myself to eat my mom s food or processed food or restaurants or street food especially since a lot of people do not use gloves here and i do not know of the food is hygienic or not i am terrified of food way more but i am not sure if this is considered an ed anymore i feel like crying when i feel like i have to eat in order to stay alive,1,325
i do not see it this time i told myself i would be satisfied this time year 11 of having cycles of anorexia recovery and relapse some stages shorter or longer depending on the cycle 3 months ago this time i told myself i would stop and be so satisfied if i was just size x again for my wedding that is it i know i have lost a little but i do not weigh myself and have not in 6 years today i went shopping and went to madewell where i know things run true to size maybe on the smaller side i tried on size x thinking there was no way no way i was that size again i know how big my body is and definitely surely had not lost enough yet to fit they fit the jeans that when i hold them up in front of my eyes absolutely no way no way can i fit into fit my body dysmorphia must be fucked i looked in the mirror at my goal size the pants on and not tight and all i see is the areas i need to lose to my brain i look no smaller maybe i honestly even look bigger to myself than i did 4 sizes up usually my body view is very clear and honest but now i am questioning everything even more than that i feel i need to keep going not stop like i told myself when i fit that size again because i do not see it the jeans must be wrong i do not know what to do,1,271
phone ads anyone else s ads on their phone like purely food literally get ads for anything even slightly food related even food places in states hours away from me,1,30
nauseated i was discharged from inpatient yesterday and was feeling pretty good the last few days with my meal plan but now that i am at home and following the plan i am ridiculously nauseated and bloated and all around miserable is this because inpatient you are literally just sitting or laying around all day and at home you are moving around more shopping cleaning etc like is this because of movement or i do not know also if anyone s looking for an inpatient facility that respects veganism i got one for ya,1,94
it is 4 20 and i want to binge so bad i want to get high with my friends so bad to quiet the negative voices but i know if i get high with them we will order and eat takeout if i eat takeout i am going to beat myself up for the next few weeks especially becuase i just got back from a ballet class that i had to take in front of the fat mirror iykyk so i am extra sensitive at the moment someone please send help i am so big backed but all i want are chicken tenders ughhhhhhh,1,104
feeling guilty i always try to eat normally at dinner with my grandparents but i always try to restrict before i was not able to this time and i feel like i overate i am feeling so guilty i just want to die i am trying to remind myself that these dinners these experiences are worth it my grandparents are in their 80s and they are not going to be around forever they even modify dinners for me because i became a vegetarian i am being so selfish but all i feel is guilty i eat the food and i hate myself more i feel guilt both ways this disorder is poison,1,112
experiences with treatment at a normal weight my ed has worsened recently and after a long talk with my family doctors i have decided to consider residential or php not sure which yet honestly as superficial as it sounds my main concern is that everyone will be thinner than me i have bulimia ednos and last time i went to res it seemed like all the other girls were anorexic and super thin and if anything i found it more triggering watching them refuse food 24 7 esp because these programs do not individualize care i am not sure if this time will be different since i am an adult now so going to a mixed age gender program whereas last time i was 17 and went to adolescent girls program i just do not know how to feel because i know this ed is ruining my life but as cliche as it sounds i really do not feel sick enough and i am afraid i will be judged by everyone else and then it will just end up being counterproductive i need you all to give me your experiences opinions and brutally honest thoughts do not sugarcoat anything please this is a big decision and i need all the info i can get thanks in advance,1,217
my mom told me i am grounded if i do not lose weight i have already lost gt  20 pounds  lt since she is been on me about losing weight but it is still not good enough because she yelled at me and shamed me today for eating fast food it was my only meal today she told me i am fat and greedy and i look like i have had kids she is the main source of my ed and she is why i hated myself but with lots of time i have finally grown to like my body and i really do not think i look big especially now that i have lost weight she said she has no respect for me and that if i do not lose gt  10 pounds  lt in a month i am grounded until i am 18 i will be 18 in literally 2 months so i would be grounded for a month for not losing weight i am writing this only an hour after she yelled at me at the gym trying to purge off what i ate today,1,188
i hate birthdays i ate a pizza half a fucking pizza two protein bars and barely walked 2½ miles tomorrow i will have to eat cake a whole piece and more leftover pizza and yesterday i had sushi potato chips and of course a protein bar i was gifted a smartwatch for my birthday all that data and info on my weight and the calories i burn are making me feel so hopeless and fucked up,1,76
i miss my authentic self living with an eating disorder is one of the worst forms of hell amp i would never wish it upon anyone i miss my true self the one who felt passionate about things amp actually had energy to engage in true hobbies amp things that brought geniune happiness when i am consumed by the ed i feel like a disconnected hollow she will there is no room in my brain for anything other than obsessing over exercise food amp numbers not to mention the way my moods are erratically swinging like a goddamn pendulum it is crazy how fast things can spiral amp it is scary i hate living like this amp i am so exhausted i still ask myself how the fuck things have unraveled so quickly i feel so alone but i never reach out to anyone about anything because i am used to swallowing my feelings down but clearly that has gotten me to a good place sarcasm intended yeehaw anyway just needed to vent i am drained and exhausted all the time physically and mentally and i just miss being able to embrace the things that truly matter how the fuck do i re connect with my passions when the only brain space i have at this point is for this fucking demon,1,222
gaining weight i have gained a few pounds i can feel it i have actually been happy and eating and not obsessing over the scale the consequence for this is me gaining weight i cannot believe it my scrubs which i always wear are so tight i want to lose the weight healthy but it is so hard not to fall back into the bad habits ugh,1,67
it is getting bad again i have had an ed in the past and i was in recovery for a few years well now it is back and i am doing all the things i use to do when it was bad years ago my mom does not help the situation as she is always talking about the way i look and how i need to get put on a shot to lose weight and she knows about what is happening i have been trying to get my mom s approval for literally everything i do and since she wants me to lose weight my brain automatically went to all the things i use to do i need to accept the fact that i am never going to be good enough for her and it truly breaks my heart i do not know what to do i cannot go anywhere and ask for help because i am still wayyyyy overweight and whenever i bring up my ed it just gets brushed off any tips on how to make it better,1,180
what is something people tell you all the time as a compliment when it actually is not i am constantly getting compliments on how flat my ass and chest is and i die a little inside everytime cuz it makes me feel like a box or a twelve year old boy what about you guys,1,55

three word horror story ed edition i will start pizza for dinner,1,12
symptoms of eds that nobody talks about i want to hear symptoms of eds that are rarely ever spoken about maybe it is more niche to you but i want to hear about it let all the gross stuff out and i am talking about every single ed not just an and mia for me it is smelling terrible bones popping and losing flexibility vertigo and acid reflux even if you have never purged,1,74
should i be happier i usually hover at around gt  48 kg lt without restricting or doing anything i have an r and diabulimia which makes it easier to lose weight than others recently i have been around gt  46 kg  lt anyways someone commented that i look skinnier and they noticed that i have been losing weight i thought i would be happy that someone pointed out that i am losing weight but it ended up just making me feel insecure and ugly and want to cry i quietly said thank you and excused myself and i cried in the bathroom am i being ungrateful should i be happier does this happen to anyone else,1,116
what helps you to not purge i noticed i have gained some weight and i have been having intrusive thoughts about doing so i think the only reason why i never purged was because i did not want anything to happen to my teeth though i feel like i need more encouragement to not do so,1,56
i realized i am not recovering anymore i do not know at what point it went wrong but it totally did i chose recovery about 1 5 years ago after half a year being in and out of treatment i suffered a lot and when going on vacation with my dad i finally realized i could never enjoy my life when holding onto my eating disorder so i chose to recover i guess my first mistake was trying to keep control by counting calories i could not bring myself to go all in so i just stayed in my comfort zone at first i still tried every kind of food just staying in my calorie limit but over the time i kind of developed fears of some kind of food that my eating disorder anorexia b p subtype did not label as eatable without having to purge afterwards and then it went like 1 i crave some specific food 2 my brain labels it as unsafe 3 i b amp p it so i can enjoy it without the calories my ana b p turned into full bulimia and it is so frustrating i binge all the time i cannot stop it is addicting and i always thought i was better because i do not actively try to lose weight anymore and do not set unrealistically low calorie limits for myself but i do restrict by allowing myself only certain food i am not recovering i am still destroying my body just in a different way and i guess the reason i still thought i was okay was that i did again most of my life back i do go to school and i do have good grades and i do go to parties and have fun but i also suffer and put myself through so much torture tomorrow 21st april is the day i first threw up four years ago tomorrow four years ago everything went wrong i guess that is why i finally realized that something has to change but i still cannot bring myself to stop counting calories and leave my comfort zone i m to scared of gaining weight i do not know what to do my lymph nodes are so swollen that my side profile looks so fucking weird my teeth are yellow the food i ate comes up just from bending over,1,398
gag reflex completely gone i have been purging 2 3 times a day for 3 days now and my gag reflex has completely disappeared nothing i do can make me throw up anymore,1,33
slipped again sometimes i wonder it is actually possible to get rid of this eating disorder me and my boyfriend to decided to be healthier and lose some weight so we are cooking healthy stuff sometimes i cheat here and there but today the moment he left home for something i ordered food to eat i binged on the food then i purged it has been such a long while since it happened even though i am overweight for awhile so i am thinking if it ever goes away because there there has been times that i was like fit and i remember feeling fine and then i gained weight it was fine for awhile but now we started this journey again and i think i felt restricted around my boyfriend and i used this opportunity to like eat what i want and like binge and purge there has been times that i was healthy i did not have any kind of like binging and purging episodes i just ate healthy counted my calories did not really obsess or think about food that much i lost weight and i was so happy why cannot i go back to this why my disordered mind has to be like this,1,208
recently went to therapy well i took the first step into clawing myself out of this hole i am in to be honest i do not know exactly how i feel about it it was your typical setup she asked a couple of intake questions tried to get to know me a little bit what my goals were etc etc it was neither a good nor bad experience and honestly i will take that as a good sign there was a pretty big green flag at the end of our conversation though not sure if this is a hot take or not but bare with me her and i both agreed that there is no cure for this disorder she compared it to having diabetes or any other sort of terminal condition i will always have it but there are ways to live a completely normal and healthy life with it as someone who is into medicine and wants to go into the medical field i kind of like that analogy maybe i am not a lost because after all,1,180
did anyone else have an unhealthy obsession with the show supersize vs superskinny i remember being obsessed with that show during my peak ed days i think i have watched every single episode was anyone else obsessed with it or did you guys have other shows obsessions during you are peak ed days,1,53
i am a seemingly healthy male but suffer from being too lazy to eat read below for details doctors say they have never seen someone like this i have always been insanely skinny despite never restricting myself of food my entire family is full of skinny men and women i already went to the docs to do blood test and all my hormones are normal still i am slightly underweight according to bmi and i am already a small dude 5 7 what i have been noticing is that since i was a teen i was always too lazy to eat i tried to explain this to doctors but they said they have never seen someone like this and have no idea what could be i do not really feel hunger unless i go 5 6 hours without eating i already tried skipping meals just to see if i would feel hunger and it takes a long time for me to feel hunger and when i am hungry i am often too lazy to eat specially the act of chewing is boring to me i know this might sound crazy but it happened multiple times where i stopped eating because i was too lazy to chew another piece of chicken for example i never waste food i just put it on the fridge to eat another day but each time i eat eating feels like a chore i have never ever seen someone like this but i do not have autism or anything i already went to check for it with psychologists still i am never really hungry and the act of chewing makes me sleepy bored tired very quickly i prefer to drink than to eat chew i am thinking of switching to a fully liquid diet to try gaining weight like drinking 4 smoothies in a day i tried to post in many sites and forums and no one has ever seen anything like this i just want to know what to do not even doctors where able to help me some say it might be depression but i doubt it since i am highly motivated to play sports and study but still not motivated to eat i would appreciate any kind of input p s i just want to say i am amazed about the awesome answers i got just a bit of clarification i live in latin america and here talking about eating disorders do not seem that common when compared to us europe also people here are naturally skinnier and shorter than us european citizens but i am still by far the skinniest man around i did not write numbers because apparently that is against the rules in this sub but my test levels were 467ng dl which thinking about now is kind of low but the doc say i should only worry if it was 250ng dl or less i have morning wood morning erections in most days so i am not sure if this testosterone levels will be impacting me i have a test at university right now but when i come back i will answer you guys back with details the adhd theory seems good since when i did the test for autism the psychologist also screened me for iq adhd and other things it deemed i probably have adhd based on the answers to the questions but autism was ruled out i also do not have any metabolical disoder,1,578
friend found me purging is it okay to send this message to her basically i 18 nb was panicking and i entered a room with our friends got all anxious after a meal and left i think one of my friends daisy 17 f noticed and went after me because when i was halfway through uh in appropriately depositing my food she knocked on the door and basically asked me to come out it was mortifying she said she would call my best friend her sister and i agreed because at this point i was more panicked and wanted her to leave so i could uh finish the job so when she left to call my friend i finished up cleared up and left one of my older friends was standing close by so i just hugged her for a while daisy came back in asking if i needed anything and i was so ashamed i could not even speak my friend excused us and sat us down my older friends know i am sick but the thing is they get it daisy is sweetness and energy and immature in a way i love about her but makes situations like this scary for me she immediately wanted to talk about how she could prevent this from happening or to know how to help but the thing is i am not able to recover yet i plan to as i am getting closer to therapy but trying on my own has unfortunately been disastrous for me in the past also when i did see my best friend she just cried in my arms i did that i made my best friend cry because i could not keep down a meal i feel horrible anyway i feel really bad now i might send her this hey dais i just wanted to text you to say i am really really sorry about earlier i have never been caught before that must have been really horrible for you and i am sorry i could not comfort you or allow you to comfort me daisy i am not your responsibility being a problem somber and wanted to support your friends able to is a beautiful thing dais but until i have enough professional advice i cannot ask for help i have experienced this enough to know this is mine to carry the reason i got distant after the fact was because i embarrassed realising you had seen me because i feel responsible for you in some sense and i know i scared you dais if you feel you want to talk to a teacher or an adult about how to deal with my relapse then know that i give you the full go ahead and you do not have to worry about getting me in trouble all the adults in my life know and id honestly much rather you talk to someone rather than just shoulder this on your own i care about you and i appreciate you trying to help me and when i know i actively want to stop i will tell you how you can help if you are still up for that but right now i am not ready for that help do not beat yourself up do not take it all onto yourself you are a good friend dais augh i feel so panicked,1,564

trying to finally commit ok so i have been struggling for a decent bit over a year now with restrictive eating for all of last year and more recently i have been struggling a lot with binge eating and am concerned that i am developing bed i have also struggled with body image for almost all of my life i have posted a couple things on here over the last few months and have been lurking on edanonymemes for the same amount of time i have also been active on edtok for longer and luckily not edtwt anyway i have been trying to stop binging for the last few months but it is just getting worse i have told my parents i honour all my hunger and i do not skip meals or act restrictive so it is purely psychological i have decided that this will be my last day of overeating binging and then i am going to try to cut out sugar obvs not all there is sugar in everything i just mean like processed for the next two weeks as that is what always seems to trigger a binge i know it sounds kind of restrictive but i have honestly tried everything and i feel like i have hit a turning point now that if i do not stop i will never be able to so i have given myself a week s ultimatum on ed spaces before i delete reddit block everyone triggering on other social media s and just try everything in my power to limit food noise i do not know what the point in this post is because it is not like i have got any moots on here or anything but i guess farewell and i hope to never see any of you again,1,302
being cold all the time sucks and it is so much more than just that my fingers are cold and it makes everything much harder to do typing is hard writing is hard moving in general is hard i get cold sweats so i can be literally frigid and still have sweat stains and a pungent stench i smell like onions if i do not keep up with hygiene which obviously is hard my nose starts to run and it looks like coke user from all the damn wiping and sniffling people assume i am sick people do not want to touch me because i am cold i am bundled up all the time which is inappropriate given i live in the south east where its just gross humid heat most of the time the only times where i am ever warm are in the sunlight and the shower both have their downsides i cannot be in the sun for too long i am criminally pale and prone to skin cancer and i hate going outside where i live it is just shitshow for my anxiety and the shower can only stay warm for so long and that time of bliss is cut even shorter by the fact that i live with multiple people your joints start to hurt as well it becomes hard to bend them i have constant goosebumps which is uncomfortable and of course the shaking sleeping sucks of course you cannot sleep unless you are drugged up like a hooker and even then the quality of sleep is shit and it reflects a lot in how you look you look cold it is not some thing you can hide people can see you shake people can see your goosebumps and empty eyes the sicker you become the less you are hidden which sucks because one of my personal gripes when talking about an is the fact that other people become obsessed over your disorder which is a rant i could get into but i will not everyone is asking all these triggering questions you cannot hide contrary to how much you really want to,1,358
please tell me it is okay to eat over your maintenance when you are drunk that is it,1,18
i just realized why it was so hard for me to figure out my hunger cues i hace had anorexia binge eating exercise bulimia basically everything and as you can guess my hunger and fullness cues were totally fucked and i used to rely on either meal plans calorie counters and so on etc but the thing is that my real hunger cue looks like this about an hour before i get ravenously hungry i get an urge to fucking fast until tomorrow skip all meals and overall a big aversion towards all foods and the thing is that i used to listen to that and it never ended well now whenever i feel that i know it is time for a snack i just find it so weird that for the normal people they usually gravitate towards food whenever they are about to get hungry while i get a complete opposite thing and this was extremely hard to figure out to be honest,1,164
does anyone else have a food they just cannot deny even if i am restricting i will down a panda express orange chicken and chow mein bowl does anyone else have a food that they cheat for,1,37
i relapsed from hearing my boyfriends sister purge i was at a family gathering for my boyfriends side of the family me on the road to recovery and his sister recovered after having dessert we all mingled around and i was looking for the toilet when i heard her and just sort of broke i did not tell anyone and it weighs heavily on my conscious i have never purged i have tried never succeeded but since then i have tried more and more because apparently i need to be better than her it is all so ridiculous i thought i was over this stupid bullshit apparently i am not i cannot just tell my boyfriend his sister massively triggers me either and i love hanging out with her she is fun and cool to be around but i just cannot get the sounds out of my head why cannot i be like that why cannot i have been admitted why do i have to struggle while being technically overweight i do not know rant i suppose,1,177
i keep hoarding amp throwing away non safe foods i struggle with an not sure which subtype but one weird thing i do is i buy food hoard it then never eat it and throw it away despite this habit i actually despise wasting food and money and i am actually not in a good place financially to be even doing this but whenever i get stressed i just throw all my food away i hate myself for this because right now i am having a family crises and yet all i think about is getting rid of the food in my fridge so i cannot eat it i feel so selfish because i have people in my life going through so much worse things and yet my ed somehow has to make everything about itself,1,136
my friend is honestly triggering me so basically i have this friend and she is the best she is so nice and always helps me when i am feeling down but a 2 weeks ago i went to the doctor and i was told i was not allowed to go to the mall with my friends i cannot run anymore i cannot dance i cannot to anything that burn to much energy basically and she has been so supportive and she always stayed with me in school when our classes were fallen out my other friends would go to the mall to shop or smth since we normally have to wait 2 hours until the next lesson but i also got a mealplan i have been very ooen about what is happening to me with my friend i have told her about the tests i had to do and that i need a meal plan i have not really told her i have a ed but i am talking about how i am in a waitlist for a ed clinic so i feel like it might be obvious but she is kind of triggering me with some of the things she says like yesterday i showed her my meal plan since she asked me about it and she said that is so much i do not even eat breakfast or lunch and then she took a piece of gun out of her jacket and ate it and said this is the first thing i ate today and we sometimes joke about the like lookmaking things i know stupid and she out of nowhere said yeah no your jaw is pretty chubby you should actually try mewing i can feel my skull and jaw so maybe i am just overreacting but like with the first thing i said she does things like that many times and it makes me feel like shit for eating,1,323
5 days into a binge cycle i just want my honeymoon phase back i have been physically tired and lacking sleep lately will be until next week due to work and aldance performances for work i have been using it as an excuse to overeat and binge and literally eat whatever whenever i want last night i already had a breakdown because i was craving donuts but something happened i was not able to get them i cried but also because of binging and overeating i am either maintaining or gaining i do not even want to weigh myself however i know that if i follow my diet i might be put in danger because i am really tired i barely get any sleep anymore i know i need to function at least okay for work and dance practices i am hella sleepy i just want to eat the chocolate caramel bar i just bought,1,155
i do not know what i look like tw weight restriction so i relapsed a few weeks back but because of easter holidays i have only been severely restricting for a week anyway i have had so many mixed messages that it is literally making me feel so much more dysmorphic about my appearance people do not normally comment on my appearance but this week i have had multiple people at uni tell me i look great and actually notice me i have just come home and it is my first time seeing my mum in a week the first thing she said to me is that i look awful and i keep catching her staring at my face with concern she has not mentioned weight loss i just said i had not slept and was under the weather but i am not sure she bought it anyway it is making me so anxious because i literally cannot see any difference in my appearance i know i am more underweight now according to the scale but i look the same and nobody s said i look thinner either i still have not reached my goal weight but i do not know how i am going to hide it if people are already suspicious nobody s ever noticed before i cannot cannot go into recovery this is the first time in 3 years i have actually felt happy with myself and i cannot try and recover and revise for exams at the same time now i am just confused and anxious and feel paranoid that i am going to be eventually forced into treatment sorry this is just a long vent i just need to sort the thoughts spinning in my head,1,291
my dietician switched my diagnosis without telling me and i do not know how to feel about it i have been seeing my dietician for the past year or so for arfid i originally had her back when i was in highschool for anorexia i am 23f now but took a break after recovering i went back this time of my own volition because i realized how many social events i was missing due to my fear of foods she is amazing i love her and she really is a dietician and therapist and friend all in one she genuinely cares and out of all of my providers i have a lot for other unrelated health reasons she is my favorite however life s been kind of sucky and so eating has been hard i really do not eat a lot not because i want to restrict mostly just because i forget or i do not get hungry if there is something i want to eat i eat it i do not count calories i do not work out i do not really care about the health of a food i try to be healthy in general but it is not a priority but despite that i have been losing weight i do not know how much i go out of my way to avoid knowing my weight this last visit she switched my diagnosis from arfid back to anorexia and i only noticed on my after visit summery she was talking about higher level care but was not pushy about it so i declined i did not think i was anorexic again when i was in high school i acted very different and restriction was basically my religion so why would she change it i am not mad that i am losing weight but i am not trying it either i am not overly upset with how my body looks functionality is questionable though lol and i know even if i lose weight only working out will trim the fat off and i am not willing to work out so i do not care so am i really anorexic have i actually relapsed after 8 years,1,367
anyone else eat like only junk food as their calorie intake i feel like if i am going to eat it might as well be something good and not just cucumbers anyone else feel this way my go to dinner is frozen chicken nuggets or like a serving of chips laughing out loud,1,53
does anyone else here work in the food hospitality industry i swearrrrrr i love and hate it so much at the same time like i having to constantly be around food all the time is just so confusing and seeing people eat normally whilst i am actively starving myself is just such a headfuck i have nearly quit a few times because of it but i need the money laughing out loud,1,72
wanting to eat everything but nothing at the same time the fridge is full of foods i want to taste so badly but i feel so guilty about wanting them at the same time this is such a miserable existence i feel like i think about food more than a non disordered person and it makes me feel fake as hell,1,61
how long does it take the body to heal from an ed since i know an ed will leave you with deficiency and depleted resources and internal damage how long does it take the body to fully heal from an ed not just talking weight restored but with it is resources topped back up and basically back to normal or as close to pre ed as possible and then would relapses reset this back to zero or would it hinder the process but not stop is completely i know it will make it stop a bit since you are back to depleting stores i feel like i cannot trust my body because i spent most of 2023 in recovery so i feel like i am just oveating when i still consume such large amounts of food i feel like all the recovery channels i have watched have already moved on past this point and are not still dealing with periods of extreme hunger and stuff but maybe it takes awhile for the body to heal and i just need to be patient,1,182
binged for the first time in a year and it was not even that great i was 1 3 into the first menu item of the great binge and suddenly realised that the taste of chocolate was too much and i could actually just stop eating but then i continued to inhale like 2 days worth of food in a couple of hours now i am lying in bed with an aching stomach and the guilt is immense and i feel disgusting for binging and there is no one i can go to for support so now i am just thinking about how i am going to have to restrict to make up for this i would really appreciate some kind words or even just a reassurance that i will be okay i really hate myself right now,1,138
popcorn and diet coke a bag of microwave popcorn and ice cold can of diet cherry coke i love this combo for dinner the meal of champions,1,27
i relapsed and feel so disgusting i went to a fair ate a fuck ton and then i purged in a portapoty i hate myself so much right now and i am almost positive someone heard me puking this is a new low for me and i feel pathetic,1,49
ed gets worse before treatment potential trigger warning no numbers discussed my parents recently found out i was messing around with food and obsessively working out the made me tell my therapist two weeks ago and she told me that we need to take action now and i am absolutely terrified personally i do not think i have a full blown eating disorder i do not restrict that heavily my bmi is low but i do not look that thin i still got my period and i do not avoid all food my therapist already called my doctor though and she spoke to my mom this afternoon we will be discussing my treatment this tuesday now i do not know but i feel like my disordered habits have become so much worse after my last session with her and having some difficult talks with my parents i feel like restricting more working out more maybe proving i am ill since i do not feel sick enough or valid enough to recover as if i am only developing an eating disorder these past two weeks now that they suspect me of having one i feel like i am faking it all and making it worse on purpose i also feel like it is all my fault everyone is so worried about me yet i really do not want to start recovery my mind is just a mess sorry for the rant,1,240
fainting on the toilet literally a shit post anyway this has only happened to me a couple times but sometimes when i take a lot of laxatives i will go to and i faint on the toilet does anyone know why this happens i thought maybe because i am dehydrated from the laxatives or the pain of the cramps causes me to pass out i do not know,1,68
control is not it a little bit funny that i think i am the one in control when i am literally a slave to my eating disorder like clearly i am not the one in charge here why would i want to miss out on life the disorder is thriving when i am isolated and miserable it is like a destructive relationship happy friday lol,1,65
those thoughts are irrational yes i fucking knowwww i know that my thoughts are not rational i know the way i am feeling is not rational but this does not change the fact that i am thinking and feeling this way fuck man this drives me crazy i am so self aware and when people say like that thought is irrational like they are the first fucking person to ever get to that idea it makes me want to scream and cry,1,82
experiences with university college mental health services at this point i am thinking of approaching my university s mental health services to get the ball rolling and if they can see me within a reasonable amount of time figuring things out from there with their input help what i saw on the website seems promising but i know they are not going to go out of their way to highlight any issues or complaints people have about said services if anyone here went to their university or college s mental health services for help with this stuff and you are willing to talk about it how did it go was it a net positive with the benefit of hindsight would you do anything differently,1,124
cope with guit after eating so i have a meal plan and i hate having it that someome has to do me my food make me want to restrict more today i have so much guilt about what i eat what is the best ways to cope with that guilt,1,50
it hurts to digest food ok so i am anorexic bullimic i have been for about 1 5 year now and i have come to the point where i purge everyday for instance today i purged twice at a mall and once at the cinema i came home late and got hungry so ate some mushrooms now i am in agony its like i can physically feel the food in me its so painful and the only way its always helps is purging but i cannot tonight i keep throwing up in my mouth but i cannot get out of bed from pain in my back this happens everyday and i get so sick its ridiculous to be honest,1,119
i think my meal plan is making me lose more weight so i fainted in class a week ago and my parents were very concerned and called the doctor if my appointment which i would have in like a few weeks could be earlier so the next day i went to the doctor and i had to do all these test like blood tests heart video and i had to be weighted again they already know i am struggeling with a ed since i lost way to much so now i finally got a appointment with a dietitian and we created a meal plan with my already excisting meals as a base its very hard but i am trying my best to follow it but i have followed it for like 5 days now and i am only losing more weight i am onviously not allowed to weight myself so i normally do it when i am going to shower so my parents do not notice and i do not know what to do i do not want to eat more because i am like so nauseous after i eat so that is not a option and i am to scared to tell my parents about it since that would mean i have to tell them i use the scale,1,220
please help me i might be in danger i do not know what i was thinking i feel so stupid i contacted a proana coach a man named daniel no clue how old he is a day after being in contact with him i felt so guilty for sending him the pictures that i did so i blocked his number he keeps making new numbers and messaging me the last one he just sent me feels more threatening it is a long paragraph one part says you have to be more careful with your privacy settings do not leave your geolocation data in your pictures i know where you live i am not sure if he is just trying to scare me or what but i am actually panicking i just want him to go away but i do not know how i am going to tell my parents this without them thinking about me in a totally different light please help what do i do,1,166
maintaining after restriction science question okay so i have been eating gt  500 750 calories  lt a day i am in the process of recovery and upping my calories right now to gt  800 900 calories  lt eventually this will continue to grow i am atypical ana so i am at a healthy weight i really like my nutritionist and she told me that even to maintain my current weight if i were laying in bed all day i would still need at least gt  1400  lt my question is this while i understand the math behind tdee and whatnot   because i have been restricting for months on end am i going to gain weight regardless as i up my calories    even if i am eating below my bmr will this come back down and eventually level out i know i should not be worried about my weight but i am in the beginning beginning stages of recovery and cannot help but think about this i used to be overweight and i fear becomming overweight again will because me to relapse back into restriction if that makes sense,1,188
i feel like a fake after two day of somewhat eating okay i had two bagels with whipped cream cheese two apples a few chips and two light and fit yogurts and i feel like such a fraud like i am not even struggling because i am eating food instead of eating as little as i can yesterday i b p and i just i cannot take this anymore i feel bloated and like everything is just sitting in my stomach i hate feeling full and hate having to fight every though i have i just want to eat normally and not feel like a monster why do i feel so awful,1,112
do an people tend to fluctuate between subtypes i feel a little invalid as an anorexic whenever i binge i am just wondering if anyone else fluctuates between the two subtypes over time,1,33
i wish i had some pseudopatient guardian kind of like a service dog but they are a person and they go at a pace i am comfortable with and we start off counting calories but it is not really calorie counting i just tell them what my ideal limit is and they either cook every meal or give me the ingredients and then they do not watch me eat but they stay in the room and we talk about unrelated things service dog mainly for the de escelation during a crisis if i get binge urges they sit there and talk me down so i do not binge same thing for purging but they would talk me down less often because i do not purge if i do not binge and they motivate me to lift in a healthy manner dream come untrue though because i am sure this service exists but it is not free and not covered by insurance,1,161
my toxic reddit trait is that whenever i see a new post on any of the big dieting subs i stalk the user s profile page to see if they are active on the ed subs too i have a pretty good radar of predicting it too when i saw someone post a cauliflower dippin dots recipe on a particular sub i knew it was one of you laugh my ass off,1,72
how long were you in residential i am dreading seeking out more treatment and i am trying to gather all the information i can how long were you in treatment for what factors influenced the length or your stay what was your experience and what do you think i should know also if you have experience with rosewood ranch please let me know what your views are my therapist thinks i should go inpatient for my eating disorder anorexia 10 yr history 23yr f my parents were neglectful while he has wanted me to go for a while now and i keep trying and failing at recovery i am coming to the conclusion that if i want to move forward in my life i kind of need this level of support i have been in complete control of myself for so long and i am terrified of being in a place where i cannot get away from doing things that because great panic i have a lot of social anxiety too thanks in advance,1,174
do you have a comfort food that is also a trigger food i do not know that is just weird for me my biggest comfort food binge food is also a trigger food for me because it was the only thing i ate during my hardest time with the disorder but it is also the most comfortable for the same reason lmao,1,62
i am so unbelievably hungry and 99 9 of my thoughts involve food i need to gain but i am scared of eating too much which is ridiculous because a limit literally does not exist when you are chronically malnourished i know if i gave into my hunger and just ate what my body wanted id weight restore and i would not feel this insatiable hunger anymore i am hyper aware of my regression and increasing brain fog that causes me to speak and move at a turtles pace i am also incredibly educated on the biological and physiological effects of starvation and of recovery yet i just cannot follow them damn i just need to force myself to eat this hunger is painful,1,124
crying because of mcdonalds so i was at house with my cousin and my brother my mum had went to walmart so when she came back with mcdonalds i freaked out we all sat down to eat but the voice was so loud i broke down all my family looked at me like an i was some alien i said to my mum i cannot she told me i did not have to eat but then my grandma came up to me and said i paid for that you better eat it my mum said she will eat later i ended up not eating i feel spoiled since my grandma bought the food and i did not eat and what is worse my mum and cousin already suspected that i am anorexic crying over mcdonalds only reinforced there suspicion,1,139
ed girlfriend vs worried and a bit angry boyfriend i have a great boyfriend he is sweet caring and in love with me before i met him i was struggling with a very restrictive ed mixed with ortho so a lot of weightlifting and clean eating or not eating at all i had kind of recovered from that or so i thought i just kept the gym thing and stuff but then i suffered a bad injury could not workout for a few months and gained some weight he knows about all of this i tried to ignore the thing because right around that time i met him and i was so happy to have this gorgeous man by my side who wanted me even with those additional pounds but after a while i recovered from my injury and started going back to the gym back to my lifts and i was feeling great because i was eating normally i was working out and blah blah blah but since last week he is been commenting on everything i eat like really a pizza that is a lot of calories or hahaha your sandwich is huuuuge that made me feel like shit so i started restricting again and he has noticed at first i told him it was only because i was stressed i actually am because life but at the 10 000th comment about my lunch i lashed out and told him to stop with the comments about my food he said i am too touchy and sensitive and that i should just laugh about it i told him that maybe a non ed person would have found those comments funny but i did not actually they triggered my ed and he got so mad at me for not telling him he made me feel like a shit girlfriend and now i feel like a burden to him he told me not to worry that we will talk about it later when he comes home from work but basically his point is that i cannot expect to be his girlfriend and deal with this alone point is i do not want to deal with anything i want to disappear right now i was so happy why did he have to say those things i feel like i have failed him now i feel like i ruined everything and i should have kept with the i am just stressed lie i am sorry for the length of this and for my english i am italian you are a great community,1,429
what do you think might have caused you to develop an ed for me it was the scale did not know what i weighed until my parents bought a scale started off with just stepping on it once in the living room when no one else was there which then turned to stepping on it a couple times a week to later keeping it in my room to step on it everyday to having it by my bed side or mirror to obsessively check from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed i feel like if the scale was never bought by my parents i would not be here in this sub laughing out loud did anyone else have a similar experience,1,127
highly embarrassing confession my recent relapse is literally just because one girl who has an ed recovery account posted her workout i hate this ed because what the fuck is this a person posting their workouts should not mess me up this much especially 5 years in with ed amp ed recovery i will give myself some grace and say this girl is also clearly relapsing but damn my mind is weaker than i thought laugh my ass off,1,79
today i ate a family sized bag of chips and half a bag of assorted chocolate bars my stomach is in pain and i hate myself why am i like this,1,31
losing my voice i have recently noticed i am unable to hold a conversation for more than an hour or two my voice gets very hoarse and my thoughts get blurry i feel like i am tired without wanting to sleep and if i do sleep afterwards i get 12 hours of deep sleep like is it just mental exhaustion and i have to recharge my social battery or is it that my vocal chords are damaged bcuz of the purging and acid reflux,1,84
feel pathetic for how validated i felt my mom is the main reason why i stopped eating because she bullies me as soon as i dare to take a bite of something even if i have not had anything in the whole day so today after 2 weeks of heavily starving she told me i look thinner she said i now look like i have a waist and have not felt so happy in months and at the same time want to slap her istg if i do not look like eugenia cooney i am a fat cow to her she also praises my 14 year old anorexic cousin s body in front of me and tells me how when we go shopping the clothes would fit her and not me and then i have to remind her she literally has to go to therapy from how severe her ed is honestly hate that my self worth depends on her,1,160
i am sick of energy drinks they reminds me of school all nighters dissapointement and false hope can somebody recomend some different way how to get some caffeine into my system,1,31
the fantasy of eating and staying skinny is there a word or phrase that encompasses the image of someone who can eat anything and still stay skinny i have always dreamed and fantasized about this idea of people in my life who seem like they can eat as much as they want and still remain slim and not just relatively slim like skinny anyway when i am restricting i tend to heavily fantasize about this ideal the best example i can give is making pinterest boards of pretty girls at restaurants or models eating junk food anyone else think about this i wish i had something more eloquent to say about this i guess in some way this is an image perpetrated by the media i always think of gilmore girls are there any other media depictions that might influence this ideal,1,142
i need to eat food to take my meds 15f here i have adhd and i take meds in the middle of the day at school after i have eaten lunch i have not been taking it recently because i am skipping lunch if i take it without food i basically go apeshit not taking it makes me feel so socially anxious and unaware i feel like half a person i just say and do the most awkward and stupid things and i hate it so much there is a visible difference between me on meds and me without i can hardly focus i am tired of this i am tired of being half a person,1,116
i keep binging and i cannot seem to get a handle on it i go through cycles sort of where i restrict pretty hard and lose a lot of weight and then i end up going crazy and eating everything in sight for the past couple of months i was in sort of pseudo recovery and i started to slip back into restricting when suddenly my body just fought back big time and lately i just get this overwhelming urge to eat more than even my maintenance i do not have access to a scale currently but i am sure i have gained weight and it is scaring me i feel so out of control lately i just cannot seem to restrict like i used to and if food is around me i actually dissociate sometimes and eat it without even being fully cognizant of what i am doing i do not think i am even underweight anymore and that is unacceptable to me i used to be such a good anorexic and now i feel like a pig just needed to vent as i do not have anyone to really talk to about about these things and therapy is not helping i wish i could just have a normal relationship with food where i ping pong back and forth between binging and restricting but at the same time it is scary to think of a version of myself who does not have an ed,1,245
going to a ed specific therapist for the first time in 5 years honestly the only reason i am doing it now is because i have been veering in the binge purge restrict cycle for the past while now compared to my old restricting habits and it is freaking me out lol but with the binging and apparently having an ed for years makes hunger cues hungry when they get clicked back on because wtf i have definitely been overdoing it and i have gained back to a normal weight which freaks me out because not going to lie i know for a fact the therapist is going to think i am some freak that just wants attention i wish she saw me 2 months ago lol but alas college mental health services are slow as fuck any advice as to how i should approach my first session i am super nervous in addition to being a normal weight because i do not really want to give up my restriction i just want to stop b p ing because clearly i am not that good at it and it is actually torture do therapists usually a ask for you are weight history and b believe you when you say you restrict despite being at a normal weight fuck bed or whatever thing i got going on right now because it is literally making my past five ish years of anorexia just so invalid maybe i am just overthinking it i do not know,1,253
trying to recover from a relapse but so scared hi guys i have been in recovery for a few months but my ed is cyclical i will do good for a while can manage normal eating and brush off the ed thoughts but relapse always comes around again it is like an itch i have to scratch and i just get really itchy anyways so i have relapsed again my parents know i do not live at home i will be letting my therapist know this week and i know it is not good for me i want to recover in the long term but i just cannot seem to kick it in the day to day mine is restrictive with a side of binging when things get too much and the binging is what i am most scared of i feel so stable when i restrict and binging always sends me into a mental tailspin i guess i have sort of been in quasi for the past few months i have been eating enough but too scared to really tackle foods that stress me out my therapist recommended i start a fear food jar i did i have it ready the list is longer than i thought lol but i just cannot start i like knowing it is there but actually trying to eat a food i know has caused me a lot of distress and may because it again just feels so daunting for context i am terrified of weight gain in the sense that i am nonbinary and my curves where i carry weight are excruciating i am so scared of binging because that rapid weight gain makes my form so much more obvious i know any body can be non binary but man i just see myself as androgynous so clearly that my curves are where i get stuck sorry for the long post just looking for advice if anyone has been in a similar spot and can offer some glowing words of wisdom that would be amazing or just how to ease into confronting fear foods instead of jumping right in i have tried to just jump in in the past and it always makes things worse,1,372
hubby triggering my ed my husband has a porn sex addiction far past anything that is normal consumption most of the women he looks at are pretty much my exact body type but with a flat stomach and it has triggered me so bad that i am sinking deeper and deeper into an anorexic relapse and i have absolutely no desire to tell him,1,64
the talk about diets strikes again i am pretty sure i made a similar post a while ago but here we go i was just starting to make dinner and a friend snaps me and he goes damn i just saw myself as i sent that i need to go on a diet and mentioned how he was feeling fat in that moment i told him he looks gorgeous regardless but i support him either way just lose do it in a healthy way is all and i mean that i wupport him but i hate that that was horrid timing because i know i gained a few these past two weeks and was trying not to spiral no one is responsible for my triggers but myself i know that i do not expect my friends ro walk on eggshells around me i just fucking hate that whenever someone i am talking to talks about diets or loosing weight my dumb ass brain takes that and goes you need to relapse immediately i was getting ready to make a pork chop and brussel sprouts immediately after that conversation wrpaped the pork chop back up turned the oven off back in the fridge pan went into the sink and left the kitchen i am tired of this ed mindset i hate that all or nothing is truly the only way i know how to loose weight,1,235
innocence i was rereading a journal from when i was 10 and i just realized i literally did not know what a calorie was till my ed got fr at 21 plus i kept a journal from 20 almost 21 to like now ish and i am 23 in 3 weeks and it is kind of so disturbing that i can like see it developing on the pages of these journals but i do not know i miss the innocence of not knowing so much not even just ed wise i am also pretty tipsy so like,1,97
how does being sick fever cold etc effect you like when you have a fever  do you tend to sympathize with yourself and give yourself a little more or is it harder to eat because you are sick do you feel like your symptoms are worse because of restriction or binging i am sick and also trying to recover but it is hard to know what my body needs on a typical day let alone a sick day,1,78
semolina tw calories mentioned i have just realised i have had an unopened box of semolina sitting in the cabinet for like half a year lol anyways i have decided to make some with oat milk and the label said it was really low in calories which seemed awfully suspicious i have checked the same brand on the internet and the label was correct it is really low in calories i checked literally every other brand in my country and abroad and the calorie percent is so much higher i am kind of scared to eat it now because i genuinely do not trust the label and the company atp this fear partly comes from my ex therapist which asked me a few months ago do you actually believe that the food labels are correct i fired her shortly after for different reasons what do i do,1,147
what do you do when you feel triggered hi i am new in recovery and it is freaking scary today and yesterday i spent having celebratory meals unrestricted without purging them while very proud of myself i also feel a lot of misplaced shame and i feel very triggered and panic y after dinner i took a shower and cried but still was strong and did not purge what do you typically do in these situations to get through this uncomfortable feeling,1,82
got rejected from an ed outpatient just got out of my intake and they said my anxiety is too high for an ed program laughing out loud got kicked out of my substance abuse mental health outpatient because of my ed they gave me an ultimatum and wanted me to go to an ed residential but i refused so i tried to find an eating disorder program where i could live at home but they will not take me either my issues with food are crumbs compared to the buffet of addiction and mental health problems i do not know what to do it is looking like i will just be without program i feel so stupid for being honest about my eating habits and anxieties,1,126
got my period back after a 1 yr of not having it i am not recovered i ate normally for a little bit and i suddenly now have it i hate my fucking life,1,34
is anyone else noticing a rise recently of more socially accepted fatphobia i of course know fatphobia is always a thing but it felt like a few years ago people were a little more discreet or condescending ex omg nooo you are not fat you are beautiful but recently i have heard just nonstop fatphobia at school mostly from thin girls there is been a lot of them calling people bigbacks or fatties or greedy basically unprovoked i guess to be funny today an aquaintance straight up said man i just hate fat people they are always doing too much and everyone just nodded and agreed maybe it is always been like that but people seem to be getting so bold with their cruelty,1,124
i need help this is more of a vent post but 26f been on this sub awhile and on this particular relapse for longer i relapsed in november 2019 if i am being honest with myself it is been hell between then and now i have done the whole gambit of disorders and behaviors i have had some therapy but it was always general psych and never ed specific none of my therapists were ever concerned by the behaviors i told them i always figured it was because i did not look the part except now i am at the lowest i have ever been and it is scaring me but i genuinely cannot bring myself to care enough about my well being to harm reduce or seek help i have been talking to my supports but they are not able to help me either i still do not think it is enough though if you look at my post history you will see the last time i went to the doctor because it was so awful i had to make a post here i will not get into it here but the tl dr is the doctor said he was not concerned because i was not thin enough to match his visual idea of an someone with an ed now i am worried if i try to seek help without matching said image no one will take me seriously and i will be pushed deeper into the disorder right now not seeking help feels like the harm reduction option even though that sounds so backwards to anyone on the surface but not seeking help is ultimately keeping me sick and making me sicker at the same time i do not know what to do i have literally no one my supports are causing more harm than good i try to communicate this but i just do not believe in myself so i have been falling silent more i feel so hopeless and alone i keep giving it time but it keeps worsening i do not know what i want from this post empathy maybe thanks for reading,1,358
at what point do i need more help hi trigger warning numbers maybe will do my best to spoiler but i am on mobile so please bear with me 18yo girl with diagnosed depression adhd history of disordered eating but no formal diagnosis mostly just restricting over exercising with occasional binge moments but they did not because me too much stress currently weigh gt  123  lt lbs down from gt  126  lt last week so not losing too quickly and i am still at a healthy bmi however started purging probably a month ago now and it is become an everyday thing my parents found out about it and i had an actually nice chat with my mom about how she could help but i also really do not want to get better anyway today i was hoping to fast for gt  48  lt hours i made it to gt  27  lt until i had a massive binge in the hopes of breaking the habit i asked my mom if i could sleep in her bed tonight which she agreed to but then once she was asleep i snuck away and purged again i feel so gross my therapist knows and she is urging me to reach out to a dietician but i just do not feel like i am sick enough yet for that and i know that the earlier you start to recover the easier it is but i do not want to get better sorry for the ramble i guess my question really is at what point does it become bad enough when do i know i need to ask for more help,1,276
does anyone else feel like a terrible friend cuz of their ed lately i have been feeling like the worst friend ever i feel my ed sucked the life out of me and pushed me away from my friends convinced me that they hated me when all they ever wanted was for me to be okay and not have my life controlled by this disorder anymore i feel so disconnected from them they all have passions hobbies dreams aspirations all i have is a foggy brain consumed by thoughts about my weight and food and a heart with no will to live everytime i try to recover i find myself stuck in the middle of not being sick enough to die but not well enough to live either i feel like they have all moved forward in life while i am just stuck in the same place since this ed started controlling me and my life i do not know who i am anymore i feel like everything that made me me was eaten up by this ed i feel like my friends do not love me the same anymore i mean it does make sense considering i have become more negative and its gotten to the point where its pushing people away from me i just want my friends back,1,221
why why do i eat so much i cannot restrict like i used to,1,14
cannot restrict anymore this is a rant i just feel like such a failure it used to be so easy but i just cannot keep it below my daily cals anymore and everytime i try to skip a meal or at least eat less i just end up bingeing on my next one and losing my mind at the sight of food and everything i have eaten is burning a huge hole in my stomach right now i hate myself for losing control and i do not know what to do,1,91
all in recovery is not real life hey folks was thinking about this all in recovery that seems to be a huge trend atm i have got to think about it and for me it does not feel like this is the ideal solution and i do not understand why people keep saying this was the only way to recover to allow yourself whenever whatever to eat why do i think that well i feel like all in is just the opposite way of soothing your emotions with food when before someone used to restrict food to whatever what extent to gain self assurance and find comfort with all in it would be the opposite i can say that because i tried to allow myself to buy all the snacks and pastries i really craved for a while and to me it feels just like a huge waste of food money and time because with all in your mind is still spiraling about food all the time exchanging food aversion with food excitement but still all the time thinking about what do i eat next when do i eat next where is the next grocery store where i can get exactly what i crave because otherwise i fail with all in instead of just living with food being seen as fuel and every now and then as a treat also i think it is important to learn to deal with the acceptance that you cannot have all the time exactly you are craving i am not speaking weight caloriewise but simply about time offer and money as already said i tried giving my mind whatever it craved for a while but it turned into going grocery shopping instead of working on my studies way too often so it was again a form of procrastination and not dealing with hard feelings and even talking myself into spending so much time on buying food was good because i was just honouring my mental hunger no to me it felt like wasting a lot of my lifetime there also must be a reason why in a clinical institution patiens are living by a mealplan and are not free to eat whatever they want all the time i think it is just a romanticized illusion this all in recovery but it is not real life because it projects our wish to become whatever we want whenever we want at any given time on food but real life is not that way we have work school friends and sometimes we need to adjust on that and cannot have whatever we want all the time this is just my opinion you can bash it if you want and i am happy to discuss,1,457
my ed gets weird when i am tired and sleepless i starve when i can but everytime we have events at work and i get busy i am part of the dance club most days i have 3 4 hours sleep and i tend to binge eat more and i do not track what i eat i do not know if it is good or bad because in my head i am already sleepless i think it would be dangerous to starve as well but like it should be a good chance because i will lose more since i move more but it is the sleepless days i fear and having the energy to function at work after practices i am so sad,1,123
my birthday is tomorrow and i forgot how triggering depressing bdays are first birthday i am spending at home with family in several years and i cannot wait for it to be over parents keep asking what i want as my birthday dinner or what type of cake i want and so on and so on but i can only shrug and say i do not know not the questions i want to be bombarded with first thing in morning whatsoever just big sad and void feeling and would rather tomorrow just be any normal day,1,96
ana gf and gymbro bf has anyone actually gotten into one of these relationships and if you did how did it go for you i see know a lot of girls who romanticize this kind of relationship i need to know how it goes realistically,1,45
help i do not know what to say in these kind of post it is my first time but i need help from anyone because someone do not know the gender contacted me on one of my social account and said that he could be my ana c0ach i do not know what to say i have been wanting one since i cannot with myself but i have read some weird stories here so i do not know what to say to the person i will write what they said to me it looks like you are struggling all alone are you interested in having an ana coach with me beside you you will finally have a sense of direction you no longer have to go through life alone i will be here to take care of you i do not know it sound weird with the last sentence but i do not have the heart to block them or anything help me out,1,164
i am appalled by how skinny i am i do not even know how to put into words how i feel but i will try my best when i look down at my thighs or look at my waist in a mirror i see nothing but fat i think about how if i shrink down as much as possible i will like what i see however when i see my full body like in a window reflection or in a picture i am disgusted my legs are quite long and so thin they look like chopsticks and because i am tall i feel like being lanky just is not a good look on me it is so confusing because it is nothing like what i see in the mirror but it is not enough to make me want to recover i really wish being thin looked better on me i am convinced that if i lose more weight i will become skinny enough that it will suit me i feel so defeated i will never like how i look whether i am very skinny or if i gain a bit of weight just an for your information i am not trying to humble brag by any means that is not my intention at all it literally feels like shit being stuck in a cycle of i am actually so thin it is repulsive to i would look so much better if i lost more weight i do not even know what to believe anymore i just want peace with my body and relationship with food,1,265
a rant on intuitive eating am i the only one for whom intuitive eating has not and will never work as someone with a restrictive ed right now if i was to follow intuitive eating i will not ever recover because my intuition will always tell me to starve and not eat and same for my binge ed that i had before this one if i followed my intuition i would just constantly be binging i am not against it or anything cuz we are all different and no one thing is bound to work for all of us and if this worked for you then that is so great but its just slightly annoying when it is presented as this works for all and the ideal best way of healing you are ed relationship with food but in my opinion this just has not and will not really work for me what are you are thoughts on it,1,159
poop 2 drank last night and i woke up and my lower stomach is making that awful grumbling that tells me i am about the experience an ungodly liquor shit throwing up out of my asshole style save me i am trying to put it off but the liquid shits are inevitable and i cannot escape,1,56
damaged teeth from purging i was purging at least three times a week for a year straight and i get depressed and binge eat and then fall asleep without brushing my teeth frequently my family has a history of having bad teeth and frequent cavities as well i have accrued thousands of dollars in dental damage it will cost about 8 000 to fix everything not including wisdom teeth removal i feel judged every time i sit in the dentists chair and i feel dread every time i look up close in the mirror and i see all of the cavities and discoloration between my teeth that most people do not see when they look at me i do not have the money to pay for all of this i do not have dental insurance and i am tired of undergoing painful and lengthy extractions and drillings and even a root canal last time i know i need to get them fixed before they become any worse but every time i think about it i get so filled with despair that i cannot do anything but try to distract myself from the problem has anyone else gone through something similar i do not expect anyone to read or much less respond but thank you to anyone who does,1,218
atypical anorexia i want to write a story about it need help little background i was diagnosed with anorexia four years ago last year my diagnosis was changed to atypical anorexia just as i switched therapists and after the weight gain part the problem is i never did the whole therapy behind the disorder i never learned to accept my new body because my ed therapist helped me gain weight to be able to get to the issues but then he wasn t available anymore so i had to find another one young and no clues about ed s i am dismissed and belittled every single time he and my psych and my nurse and literally everyone i reach out to ask what s your bmi and that is it we never talk about it i never get the help i relapsed a few weeks ago and am on my way to get the regular anorexia back so that i finally get help with being in my body and to be able to recover i can t do it on my own sadly it s honestly so sad you know i spend the majority of my day on the floor from passing out just yesterday i hit the corner of a table and i have a bruise on my face i look in the mirror and think okay i kind of look really sick skin color and bruise wise and think i ll be in trouble when therapist nurse shrink ask about it they do not but they tell me that i seem calmer that i seem more confident and like i am coping well that they are proud how well i am managing and we will be able to start exposure trauma therapy now since i am better i just nod but i want to cry truth is i am cold i am so nauseous and my head hurts i don t think about trauma i don t really feel anything emotion wise i m tired and i am trying not pass out and some days i wish i would because maybe then they would listen in my personal experience i suffer more than when i was regular and underweight because then they cared they helped me atypical anorexia is worse for me than just anorexia and i know that i am not alone in this i want to write a story that comes with atypical and i have personal experience and obviously know what it s like but i really need your guys experiences what would you find important in the story what is your personal experience with this thank you so much and please take care,1,449
so motivated to recover until there is actual gain i feel like a dishonest fuck just venting i am so ready to give up my behaviors until i actually gain any noticeable weight then it nearly goes out the window because i become so uncomfortable then it starts with small things like ill just skip my carbs for a few days or c s my snacks instead of finishing them before i know it i am telling people i am recovering and i am still fucking pulling this shit i feel like a waste i only know how to control food and self harm to soothe myself it is so hard to get out of this i feel less guilty for throwing away food if i at least put it in my mouth first like i am actually eating it like it is not the same shit,1,147
what the fuck is intuitive eating like genuinely i do not understand how people just eat intuitively what the fuck i am at a point where i am so sick and tired of this ed and genuinely want to recover but every time i try to eat maintenance or up my intake or just deviate from my usual plan i binge like i genuinely do not understand how intuitive eating exists and i do not know if i will ever be able to get there again i have no sense of fullness satiety amp the only way i see food is in numbers just eat you are cravings listen to your body s cues babe my body wants me to eat like a 6ft tall linebacker who trains for the olympics 3 times a day and no this is not extreme hunger this is not internalized fatphobia or whatever i have tried intuitive eating and gained weight so rapidly it was scary at this point i am not even that into restricting anymore sure i would like to lose more but the main reason i am still restricting is because if i deviate even a little i turn into a feral animal who eats everything in sight i hate this and i feel trapped i feel like ana or bed recovery is sm simpler than this not saying it is easier just simpler because at least recovery is one directional if that makes sense this ednos bulimia shit is the worst i just oscillate between the two extremes and get nowhere but also i cannot imagine myself ever eating normally again what the fuck do i do,1,277
can i get some opinions recovery tw this question might be triggering for some in recovery please proceed carefully i myself am not in a good place right now and i am aware of that last thing i want is for these ideas to rub off on anybody else is there any point in seeing an ed specialist if i have no intentions of recovering in your opinion not asking for health advice just curious all my friends have been urging me to see a therapist about my ed but if my options are recovery or inpatient i do not want it,1,102
tw i think i might have exercise bulimia i cannot stop bingeing gt  10k  lt cals every week to compensate i have been going to the gym 4 times a week and walking gt  20k  lt steps a day i do not know what to do it is so exhausting i wish i was able to just high restrict and exercise less obsessively because my maintenance cals are like gt  2500  lt so i could get a decent amount of food in but i just have no self control this is taking over my life right now everytime i binge i do not sleep all night and then sleep all day i do not have the will or energy eegy to brush my teeth or clean up the aftermath of my binge then i force myself to get out of bed and go to the gym for an hour and go on a long walk i am so scared it is not working though and that i have gained i just want to have a less destructive relationship with food my bingeing is getting scary out of control,1,188
wishing you could go back to old habits i used to restrict heavily and was significantly skinnier than i am now the past year or so i have been having problems with binge eating i feel like people would judge me for saying i have an eating disorder at the weight i am currently at because it obviously implies that i binge eat i wish so bad that i could restrict again and lose all the weight i have gained in the past year i get that restricting and bingeing are equally bad but i felt such a high when i would restrict and see the number on the scale keep dropping now every time i see myself in the mirror and am reminded of how much my body has changed for the worse i want to cry often times when i think about having to eat i feel extremely anxious because there is always a chance it could lead to a binge or i will just feel guilty for eating at all more than anything i just want to be healthy and normal,1,184
prozac and weight does prozac affect weight in any way losing gaining a lot of people keep saying contradicting stuff and while prozac is supposedly weight neutral does it affect the metabolism,1,32
my boyfriend told me my butt has gotten smaller i sobbed for about 20 minutes i have worked really hard at the gym to get to the point i am at and the fact that my relapse over the last few months has destroyed a lot of that is really fucking eye opening,1,53
i think i might be developing an eating disorder tw mentions of suicidality and self harm i have never done anything like this before and while i have had some body image issues in the past the weight related ones are almost entirely behind me since i transitioned but this week it is been incredibly hard to convince myself that it is okay for me to eat that i deserve food i have had a granola bar a day since my antidepressants cannot be taken on an empty stomach and other than that i have only had two meals this week i just feel like i deserve to starve i am sure this is not normal or healthy but i do not know if it is an eating disorder or suicidality or just more self harm both of which i have also been struggling with it kind of scares me but i do not know if i can stop,1,159
what is something about you are peak ed days that you do not miss at all for me it would have to be eating the most disgusting low cal  healthy versions of my fear foods and acting like i enjoyed them or the absolutely unbearable bad breath from not eating drinking and the god awful insomnia with the sound of my stomach rambling echoing through my ears the whole night what about you guys,1,74
how to not think about food constantly i am in recovery and i have been doing good at eating all my meals the problem is in between meals when i am not hungry at all i still want to snack constantly and grab something every time i walk through the kitchen i am coming back from heavy restricting and i do not want to overeat i have done that recently and genuinely thought i was refeeding and was going to die i just always want a snack even if i just finished eating and i am stuffed has anyone else do not anything that helps this,1,106
trigger warning purging i feel like i cannot stop binging and purging but i do not want to die early because of it is there any way i can minimize the damage,1,32
i just stopped a mini binge i bought ice cream and did not eat the entire tub in one go i am saving the rest for later and like that is such a big achievement omg i think it is a mix of a couple different things that made me stop including the fact that i am doing somewhat better mentally atm so that is always good,1,67
am i the only one did anyone else felt that their ed improved something about themselves in a good way ik that sounds weird i mean like for me when i was in my depressive episodes which was a lot more often before i could not get out of bed my room so my hygiene was not the greatest i would not shower for a whole week and i did not brush my teeth at all only when my mom pointed out that my breath smells or my teeth are yellow but my ed oddly helped me get a better routine with my hygiene i take cold showers often because the cold burns calories more and i brush my teeth everyday sometimes 3x just so i can have something to taste because of those damn cravings during fasting,1,138
why do i still feel fat while healthy bmi but my period is 3 months late i am just maintaining my weight trying to restrict but always have atleast one meal per week i am failing at restricting feel fat but then my period just is not coming i am healthy but period nowhere to be seen it almost got me worried because during my lowest weight a year ago i had my period once every two months now its just completely off yet i weigh more i am frustrated and so tired of exercising so much worrying about my stupid weight and looks and not living normally i hate it but i always say i just have to reach my goal weight and then i will start eating more normally without such obsessions but the goal weight just is not coming i feel like a failure in all aspects of life i will never recover because how can i not want to be thin its so stupid like why does it matter what i look like it does not in the big picture why is my brain so stubborn,1,190
help me eat more fix my hunger cues hey hey not sure if anyone here is even equipped to help me figure this out but a recent relapse into low res an r culminated in a prolonged period of fairly intense restriction gt   sub 500 calories for about a week   lt which i have never really done before for the most part i try and eat high res just shy of my bmr as a form of harm reduction or damage control and i have been forcing myself to get back to my usual routine here is the issue for the first time ever my hunger cues are totally shot i am not hungry at all and every meal i do try to eat makes me nauseous for at least half an hour results in mild abdominal pain i also seem to have developed constant low level heartburn which is unpleasant i cannot help but attribute all of this to my ill advised week of low res i am not sure whether it is just a temporary slowdown in my digestion that will resolve with time and dietary consistency or if there is anything else that might be wrong but it is so frustrating and painful i hate this disorder and i hate that i tricked myself into believing that there was a right way of going about being anorexic but there is no winning heavy restriction makes me feel like a walking corpse and eating normally causes literal physical discomfort there is no fucking winning with this thing any tips on recovering hunger cues and mitigating post meal heartburn nausea cheers thanks in advance,1,275
i feel like an apocalypse scenario would cure my ed i feel like something like a zombie apocalypse would cure my ed i mean you are constantly on the run and burning calories you are forced to be fit food is scarce and so the hoarding mentality becomes a necessity any food i come across is a blessing so i cannot be picky and i need to be strong mentally and physically i legit cannot have an eating disorder in the zombie apocalypse,1,83
looking through old photos just wanted to know if anyone else has a similar experience but i keep looking at pictures of myself before my eating disorder and missing them like finding myself pretty and regretting restricting and doing everything i did even though i still do it because the fear of being healthy gaining weight and being invalid is too much i used to take pictures of some of my favourite foods and me eating them and i just miss it looking at those photos i just seem so much happier and better and i wish i saw myself the way i do now too i do not know if this makes me invalid or not but it is just something that is been on my head i miss intuitively eating and being happy ed s take so much more than that and it feels like an empty pit,1,150
what is the most embarrassing problem uve encountered as a side effect of you are ed for me it would have to be pelvic floor dysfunction literally the most embarrassing thing ever what about you guys,1,36
my mum told me i am getting body builder problems then said your thighs i have recently started lifting weights and i am getting stronger but i fear i may never recover from this comment i am already insecure about my legs aghhhhh,1,43
my antidepressants make me feel sick while restricting i have noticed that when trying to take my antidepressants on an empty stomach it makes me feel very physically ill like i can barely move always on the verge of puking type of ill this should be a sign to eat more but instead i feel like i have taken it as a reason to avoid taking my meds amidst bouts of heavy restriction its so frustrating because i know how is stupid of an idea it is but i just cannot get myself to eat more for the sake of my physical or mental wellbeing anybody else going through this any advice or recommendations to help,1,116
binged twice in a row tw weight i really need some comforting words right now i feel so bad guilty disgusted the typical aftermath of a binge basically my mom bought a whole box of mochi balls bread 6 a box i ate all of them and then i ate junk food and leftover dinner i did not even microwave the leftovers i just ate it cold i feel like i am crazy i am not even near skinny i feel so invalid for struggling with food how can a chubby person struggle with food i want to gt delete myself lt sorry if this is sensitive i am trying to word it without making it too triggering because i cannot believe that eating is such a problem for me i have gained weight last year gt about 8 kg lt and i have not been able to lose weight as much as i want to i have tried everything in the book but i only gt lost 1kg lt i am really upset with how i look restricting is so difficult now because i think about food so much i love but hate food so much even now i eat normally of course it is not going to be entirely normal it is always going to be a bit disordered here and there but 3 meals and snacks and i do not feel good about myself i try to limit my intake as much as i can but it does not work i am so defeated i do not know what to do after a binge my day is usually wasted i do not even know why i binged my mom bought a box of pastry and i ate them all and then some i do not know why i do not know how i hate this feeling i feel so guilty and fat and just not good i do not like this i feel so ashamed and so out of control,1,333

why are healthy people just so casual about judging peoples food i have got some pretty simple safe foods currently living off boiled eggs veggies fruit cheese sticks and sometimes yogurt and oatmeal i also eat eggos do not know why those are fine but yk the bulk of my intake comes from these cappuccino keurig pods anyways i was making some coffee and flavored water and decided to have a little snack boiled egg and red hot s hot sauce its 0 cal super awesome and yummy too just to make the egg more filling and delicious and less depressing i try to make a conversation with my parents about how good hot sauce and boiled eggs are my dad proceeds to start criticizing me for eating it because of my acid reflux yes i have developed acid reflux but if i am eating something and enjoying it should not you be glad i feel like i am only person who does not ruin other food for people i do not spew diet culture rhetoric saying oh that is soooo bad for you i mean of course i judge it is a part of the package but i do not try and control other peoples eating habits because at least they are eating do people just really have no compassion for others anymore why do not people do research on their loved ones issues everyone knows i have an eating disorder and yet everyone scathes around it except for my mother who is waaay too into my business with it and makes me even more uncomfortable and yet still they have no bother to learn about it or show kindness towards me and my issues like i do for them they will openly talk about not eating all day and trying to lose weight to me like that is not triggering in any way sometimes i think they are also disordered and are just significantly less than me and so they proceed to use me as a trigger or for comparison,1,342
i do not want an ed vent tw sh this is just a vent post also i do not actually have an ed or i do not know maybe i am just in denial but if this post does not belong here please tell me and i will take it down so i have been cutting for about a year now and i have finally decided to quit but i think i am falling into another unhealthy coping mechanism i have started calorie counting and have been severely restricting for the past month i do not want to call it an ed but i do not know it is probably not healthy i have been trying to up my daily calorie intake from what i usually eat because i have been starting to feel fatigue and stuff but already just that is hard i feel like it is too much and like the lower the calories the better it is weird cus i feel like calories bad but like i know they are not but i feel like the healthiest thing would be to ideally eat no calories and i just do not have any willpower even though i know that no healthy person thinks like that i have been watching of herbs and alters videos about eds and i do not want an ed cus ik they can be really really bad but i also want to lose weight so ig i will try to do it in a healthy way but i feel very conflicted cus like when i first started it was not even for the weight loss i just wanted to starve myself and have that sense of control i feel like if i eat more i am losing that control and i am like i do not know pigging out ig but i really do not want to get an ed so if i am going to just have to toughen up and lose weight the healthy slow way grhehhrhhfhfhfh why do i do this to myself i feel like i am addicted to suffering,1,350

the moral of the story is we do not talk about bruno not expecting anyone to read this but i had to get it out somewhere as it is been eating me alive after all it is not like i can talk to anyone about it i have allowed myself to grow complacent lately i was at a family gathering and i got a little loose lipped about my ed later on some of my aunts confronted me about it they were saying that talking about that stuff could be triggering to my cousin who had recovered from an ed then they were going on about how i need to be in therapy i have had bad experiences with that it almost felt like an intervention now i feel like a monster i did not mean to hurt anyone now i am kicking myself for being so stupid i could not tell anyone but this triggered a severe episode of depression and guess what my favorite coping mechanism is oh well lesson learned if anyone asks i recovered in reference to the catchiest song in disney s encanto we do not talk about bruno,1,194

anyone know how to find nonfiction media about men with anorexia so i have been trying to write an essay about a character in a tv show having anorexia but i have been struggling to find any substantial resources for statistics experiences and whatnot that are specifically related to what i am trying to write about as the character is a cis man i dealt with anorexia so i do understand the disorder more than i would others but i was afab and did not even realize the nuances and different ways it could often manifest in men until i started doing research i just want to get a better grasp on the subject since all the sources i have found do not go into too much detail and if they do focus on men with eating disorders it is typically on orthorexia or muscle dysmorphia anyway yah i am just wondering if anyone knows a book or a website or whatever that would be helpful for learning about men with anorexia because oy gevalt every single thing i look at hardly touches on that experience if at all like okay girls who do blah blah blah when they are young are more likely to eating disorder behavior when they are older good to know but this is not relevant to the point i am arguing but yah any help would be appreciated,1,233

the world will not end if you end up in a larger body after recovery this is the place your body wants to be at xx but it will like why tf do you think i have an ed i will not just make peace with it i have been at war with my body and mind for years now i will not suddenly change how i feel about things this sentence is the one that really infuriates me and i am aware that this is probably my ed mindset talking but i just cannot see myself in that situation without being unhappy i will always feel the need to have some kind of control over my body or food so it is not as easy as just getting over it,1,131
i relapsed started restricting 3 days ago and everyone is telling me i look so depressed already my lethargy and fatigue set in way quicker than the first time i was anorexic and i found myself lugging my body and walking slowly but so tired in the hallways i saw two of my friends walk by but i pretended not to notice them because i was just too exhausted to pretend to care i do care about them but right then i was so drained and hungry later when i had a class with them both of them asked me in unison as soon as they saw me are you okay and i thought they were wondering about the bandaid on my face i tripped and fell on concrete but they started saying that i looked so sad in the hallway when they saw me and i knew exactly why i know was not looking bright and perky but i did not realize i was hanging my head and frowning they told me they wanted to ask if i was okay i thought i just looked like a normal teenager who did not get enough sleep or something i assured them i was just tired in the morning and smiled and laughed with them then after school my dad picked me up and asked me how my day was i was exhausted and replied quietly and he asked me why i sound so depressed i just said i was tired,1,250

opinions on diagnosis i am currently trying to recover my period after a pretty classic red s case and stress fracture i had a few months where i was not restricting and was trying to gain weight back to recover it but after hitting my previous scale weight i just found it impossible to tolerate and started restricting again after hearing this my sports dr referred me to a dietician and mentioned eating disorders in that appointment and asked if i had a psychiatrist who was versed in that topic as well the thing is i sort of have a hard time admiting i have an ed or not and do not really want to bring it up to my psychiatrist most of my other mental health issues are cases where a diagnosis is not helpful and can actually be a bit harmful possible bpd but like i said me and my psych have agreed a formal diagnosis is not helpful and just treat the symptoms without one i guess i am wondering if ed is similar and if its even worth trying to bring up i feel like as soon as the topic comes up people look at you differently and start distrusting you what are yalls experiences with beginning care and getting diagnosis was it worth the official stamp or have you gotten treatment without that,1,228
rant trigger warning i am so hungry so i relapsed around january febuary of 2024 so i have been doing everything i can to lose weight for the past 2 5 3 months and i am just so fucking hungry like i am watching those 10000 calorie challanges just to see people being full but i feel like i could finish any of the challanges easily without a problem worst thing is that i have not even lost weight because turns out that equal sweetener does have some calories in it and i have been consuming so much of it that my calorie count was literally off by a couple hundred calories daily which is insane the only good thing about this is that my extreme hunger really makes me want to get better and eat more,1,137
i need advice so today is my grandma s birthday and we planned a surprise party for her on saturday a lot of our family members are coming we are sitting down to eat together nobody knows about my eating problems and i do not want them to get suspicious i know what is being served and it just too much for me to try and i do not know what to do i tried getting out of it but i cannot,1,82

do the ed thoughts ever go away i have been in recovery for the past 2 years after numerous ed relapses throughout my teenage years although i currently have the best relationship with food i have ever had and am in a good place mentally i still have restrictive thoughts everyday and have to make a conscious decision not to listen i know i never want to lose myself to my ed again but cannot help but wonder if the intrusive thoughts ever go away even with long term recovery,1,90
am i the only one who does this compulsive picture taking i am not even only talking about full body checking pictures even though that in itself is a huge part of it for me but literally just an outrageous uncontrollable urge to take pictures selfies of myself even though i do not even like how i look in 75 of them i stg i have had this issue for years and i do think it is connected to the ed in some way but i am embarrassed at the amount of storage all of this pictures take up on my phone and yet i cannot get myself to delete any of them even though like 90 of them literally look exactly the same i stg at one point i had over 50 000 pictures on my phone and omfg i sound psycho even typing that out please tell me i am not the only one because i feel fuckin insane i do not even think i have ever asked about this before but i am honestly so curious if anyone else does something like this got to love compulsions man,1,191
throwing up made me realise how bad i am at chewing i am actually surprised at how there is literal huge chunks of everything like meat and veggies and anything else i never knew i was so bad at eating i think it has to do with my urge to eat that makes me consume so fast without chewing properly,1,60
does anyone else get a runny nose after eating drinking literally anything while restricting i remember seeing a post about this in another sub but i am pretty sure original poster deleted it because it would have been better to ask here but back to the post i legit mean anything it does not matter if i eat something cold hot sweet spicy sour or even if i just drink a soda no matter what my nose just starts running but this only happens when i am restricting s,1,89
i need recovery motivation please i am seeing an ed nutritionist for the first time this week i have also been going to the dr and am basically mentally approaching recovery but as i get closer to this initial session i am feeling hesitant and anxious i was feeling eager before to meet with her and begin to recover but now i am feeling scared and like i do not want to do it even though i know i do anyone have advice for someone in the beginning stages of recovery everyday it is like this inner battle with myself between you want to recover and you want to lose weight and stay in control because this is all you have got i know i want to recover but sometimes it does not feel worth it likewise i do not feel sick enough for recovery and feel like i need to lose just a little more weight first but i know if i do i will just get deeper into my ed and it will be hard to get out mostly looking for advice support thank you,1,187
that feeling when your mom notices your weight loss i am 23 and live in an apartment with my bf and do not visit my family a lot my mom has always been super judgmental about my size and eating habits which was a big contributor to me developing an ed in the first place when i was 11 i have been relapsing for a few weeks now my mom came to visit me today and get something from me and called me skinny mini that feels so oddly validating but also weird because i have not even noticed much loss but apparently she did,1,105
aaaa extreme hunger help i am going insane i want to eat everything i see i am so fucking close to a normal bmi and i thought i was doing so good at being in a deficit without giving in to disordered thoughts last week i was all i will just do this like a normal person and it even worked for 5 days i felt okay and calm and i could eat a small portion of something good without wanting to inhale 8682 more portions but ever since sunday i cannot my brain is screaming at me to eat and eat and eat and i do not want to i already went so much over these past two days but it feels like i am going to die if i do not i do not understand what is wrong with me why cannot i just relax and lose these last x pounds and then maintain it why why why am i sabotaging myself because i am too scared of maintenance probably laugh i will fucking lose it i cannot think of anything but food and calories and numbers and math i though i was over it but clearly not the closer i get to my goal normal bmi the more i can feel my sanity slipping so demoralizing to realize i am back in the same fucking situation i was during my teens maybe i am just fundamentally broken,1,240
how did you start to talk about it first off thank you to everyone who commented on my last post i want to get better i really think i do but how do you begin to tell someone especially a mom since i am not stick thin i feel like she will brush it off especially since she wanted me to lose a bit of weight but i do not know how i would begin the conversation with her with anyone really,1,82
i am worried it is only going to go downhill from here i am just a few pounds away from being underweight but i have only had disordered eating for less than year and already have some slight medical issues because one of the causes is related to some traumatic experiences that happened when i was fat i am worried i cannot stop myself from sliding further once i hit my next goal weight i have already shifted my goal weight at least 6 times can someone reassure me that it is not a slippery slope,1,96
i hate having a wide ribcage that is really all i detest my wide rib cage and shoulders i hate having loose skin i hate being slim thick i just want to be like one single little bone standing upright no flesh no face no head just a vertically straight bone going about daily life really though there is no amount of starving myself that can make my ribcage smaller or get rid of my loose skin and it actually makes me want to peel my very being from this earth i feel like a barrel,1,96
baby steps i deleted loseit i cannot help but count the calories in my head but it is gone baby steps i am also making the transition from strictly cardio at the gym to a mix with strength training some days i even feel okay enough to only strength train sometimes i am afraid the muscle build up will make me look bigger but baby steps,1,66
posted some recovery advice and people s comments were so triggering it set me back i will not say where i posted to try and keep with the rules but i had to get this out somewhere i posted some of my advice that i thought was a general bit of helpful advice for anyone who might feel like they have overeaten regardless of the intake well do not people start coming in to the comments of that post saying shit like if you overeat there is something wrong with you over eating means you should see a doctor i rolled my eyes at this so hard i cut out blank and i have lost so much and like cool love that i just posted some of the advice i had been following to help me recover from my last relapse and when i read those i realized that it is my fault i am still fat because all these people think it is so easy to not eat too much and clearly i am the problem so i just went on a 7am tirade and emptied out all my nice treat food i was allowing again straight into the trash and now all i have left is fruit and veg and low calorie foods it was not even like proper recovery advice it was to be gentile with yourself because we all inevitably mess up but i guess that is wrong because all those people are perfect and it is me who just does not have the willpower to stop,1,261
they are finally talking about discharge from the ward and harm reduction d after a year on an eating disorder unit i have started to conform for the last 3 months i have not missed that many meals i have had leave where my dad told them i ate everything on my meal plan when i did not i pretty much just ate a plate of vegetables basically i have been putting up a facade i have been secretly exercising and purging they keep on telling me to stop telling them i am fine and be honest and are a little suspicious about the knee pain but apart from that they are granting me more leave and say i am ready for discharge i am so happy this place has been torture they know i will just go back to my ways so they are talking about harm reduction instead of recovery so i loose weight more slowly i do feel slightly given up on but i am happy i am getting out soon whoop they will probably discharge me under a cto so if things do go tits up they can just pull me back in here they said it is unethical me being in here so long they are finally seeing from my perspective,1,216

i want to make a full recovery butidk how to start and i am deathly afraid of weighing a healthy amount i am so tired i legitimately hate this i do not want to recover but i do not want to waste the rest of my teen years like this i have been underweight my whole life it is just natural for my body but my highest weight was so close to healthy i could not live with myself if i ever got to a healthy weight i just could not do it i am not ready to let go of being underweight i am so scared constantly and i am at the point where i am eating normally mostly but i am living in so much fear constantly like i am in limbo i am scared i am not sure which flare to use but this is a vent so i will say trigger warning,1,156
struggling i went from anorexia to binging and purging and i gained a ton of weight i hate the way i look i drink to cope with my feelings and now i am a full blown alcoholic addiction runs in my family heavily and i cannot stand the fact that i have repeated the cycle i have been struggling to eat and i am working out everyday and i have been getting thinner again i asked my mom how come you have had an eating disorder your whole life but you could not recognize when i was at my lowest and she said you never had an eating disorder i do not know why i ever asked her anyway since she is a narcissistic drug addict and never cared about me anyway but she really triggered me because she can call me fat but she was proud of me when i was an extremely low weight,1,156
ice cream cheese bread peanut butter everyday i think its cuz its just simple fact that these things taste so good to me but did anyone find they were living each day in recovery with consuming these foods everyday its like i feel guilt that i am not as strong anymore to turn away these foods anymore but i still eat them regardless but i know i cannot be eating them everyday and need to get back into a routine of spacing them out more any advice helps xx,1,89
if you are anemic like me special k the cereal is a good deal so as a person with iron deficiency anemia life can be challenging sometimes i developed anemia after several years of caloric restriction as well as being on a high dose of lithium for some time i have been off of it for a year now whenever i experience a about of anemia i become ill especially on my period since i am currently not eating much due to life stressors trying to get enough iron in me is difficult one safe food for me over the years is dry special k cereal mostly the original kind but i like to mix it with the strawberry kind i learned just now after buying a box that a serving of special k has a 60 daily source of iron i am currently eating some while i type out this post my period starts this week amp i just sustained a bad cut to my thumb so my iron levels are low special k is low fat amp low sugar for those concerned if anyone else would like to contribute their favorite low density high iron rich foods please do so,1,202
falling face first into a hard relapse and finding it hard to see why not i have not weighed myself in forever but with the way i have been uncontrollably binging for months now i know for sure the number is not pretty neither am i and i have not been for the longest time the funniest thing in the world has triggered this finally updating my contacts prescription and daring to look in the mirror at my naked body before i took a shower i have destroyed myself my boobs and stomach are layered with more mountains of fat than i thought and without the blurring factor i see with 20 20 vision that i cannot even convincingly suck in anymore my favorite jeans are a blob over my backside and thighs how did i let it get this bad i hate to dive back into such a harmful series of behaviors but with how unstable my life is in literally every other area if i do not ground myself and spend everyday in fear of the mirror and of people looking at my gigantic body how can i even live what is the point,1,196
want to know what the worst thing is want to know what the worst think is i will never be able to recover fully ever i am always going to have some sort of disorderd mindset i already made it my only negotiable plan that if i am ever forced to recover ever i am going to basically just become ortho that is out of fear in recovering in a bigger body i see the way fat people specifically fat women are treated and it makes me never want to end up that way ever in my life no matter what the circumstances are i will never not worry about calories or weight and just be healthy it is never going to happen i was never overweight but when i lost weight even at a already healthy weight people still complimented my weightloss as if i was not already healthy to begin with the worst part is when you are in that awkward stage were you are just bordering being underweight because people just tell you that you look good but the drastic change within 2 months and people go from saying you look good to worrying about you because you look skeletal one thing my ed taught me was that people switch up so fast and even if they mean well,1,222
i think my ed will be what will kill me i am being serious and i do not mean to sound depressing i am under the belief that a few people just cannot recover fully maybe they will not be extremely underweight or in the depths maybe they will be in quasi but it will never fully be gone i think that is what will happen for me i am not extremely underweight but the health problems i have developed are piling up and getting worse in all seriousness it is been over 4 5 years i have been in treatment multiple times all different stages i have suffered multiple types and subtypes of eating disorders i do not even feel like recovering anymore honestly it is just so much work to just relapse anyways i do not know that is just how i feel,1,145
coming off risperidone because of weight gain so i was put on risperidone in 2021 will not go into why but i needed it at the time what they failed to mention to anorexic me was the extreme increased appetite and weight gain it can because i would have a small period of restriction and then months of overeating and binging these meds made me gain from underweight to overweight over the course of a couple years i have with support of my psychologist come down slowly and i am now on 0 5mg i am hoping i can come fully off it and my appetite goes back to my normal and i am praying my weight will go back down because at the end of the day my ed never left and i am still very much in it i just hope that i can become happier wit my body again,1,152

the fear of having a compulsion is killing me firstly i have to say that i do not want to draw attention to or promote any ed it is just my rant hello good morning good afternoon or good evening whatever time you are reading this i have been facing problems with binge eating and mild food selectivity in addition i am bipolar and depressed all diagnosed by my psychiatrist recently on april 13 2024 i had once again gone on a trail that i always do with my brother and the family dog maggie everything was going well until we arrived at an asphalt area and normally in addition to the cars passing slowly there we always had the habit of carrying maggie in our arms it turns out that that day an unknown motorcycle sped up when it saw maggie and ran her over breaking her neck and killing her instantly my brother cried a lot in addition to being bitten by it and having to go to the emergency room even though i was the youngest i had to carry my brother and my dead dog home my brother cried for hours but i could not cry a single tear even though i really wanted to that scene the weight of guilt everything made me want to have a compulsion and normally when i have binge episodes i eat absolutely everything even what is inedible i want to have a compulsion not to die i want to have a compulsion to pass on my guilt to tell you the truth i just wanted someone to tell me it was not my fault but they did the opposite i know it is my fault i always do everything wrong i do not eat right i have binge episodes everything is horrible sorry for the long text but for those who read this far thank you or sorry for wasting your time,1,323
what is the weirdest reason you are currently self conscious about your body i say currently because most things i am self conscious about change so frequently and i am sure it is probably similar for a lot of us so for the past couple of weeks i have been really upset by what i am calling my fat knee pouch it is this little soft pouch that is on top of the outside of my knee i have absolutely no clue if it is actually fat or muscle or something else entirely lol i have never noticed before and all of a sudden it is the only part of my body i can think about i am sure i will get over it and find a new thing to hate next week,1,133
i feel like i have ruined my body forever and i am not sure what to do i have been on this train since i was 10 years old all i fucking know is starving myself or gaining it all back through binge eating i was doing well for a while maintaining a healthy weight after losing gt  110 lbs then i got really uw  lt not even consciously i was just so afraid of any food i knew i was going to die and the only thing i knew was to start fucking binge eating about now i feel like i am going to die again its been like this for 10 months and i have symptoms of pre diabetes and have gained gt 30 pounds lt i tried to do something good for myself i tried to put on muscle i tried to eat healthy food of all food groups and i feel like an abject failure in every single way i need to lose weight to feel comfortable in my skin like gt  10 lbs 15 lbs lt but i cannot physically afford to lose any more muscle mass because my body has been through so many extreme weight loss phases i have none i do not know what to do anymore my health is in genuine shambles and every time i try to fix stuff it gets worse i just want to know that there is hope somewhere even if i never 100 recover or feel good in my body i would just be happy if i were healthy physically,1,264
migraines when restricting when i am eating below my maintenance calories i get the worst migraines then i binge because i want relief from the pain and unfortunately cannot take nsaids due to health issues caused by bulimia to counteract these binges i have started abusing lax again i told myself i would never go back to doing this but here we are i have been in this cycle for a while now and i cannot seem to break it i have started drinking electrolyte drinks but it has not stopped the migraines i am just so frustrated restricting was so much easier when i was in middle school now my body is fighting me my mind torments me regardless there is no winning,1,124
i think my ed will be what will kill me i am being serious and i do not mean to sound depressing i am under the belief that a few people just cannot recover fully maybe they will not be extremely underweight or in the depths maybe they will be in quasi but it will never fully be gone i think that is what will happen for me i am not extremely underweight but the health problems i have developed are piling up and getting worse in all seriousness it is been over 4 5 years i have been in treatment multiple times all different stages i have suffered multiple types and subtypes of eating disorders i do not even feel like recovering anymore honestly it is just so much work to just relapse anyways but i do not know that is just how i feel,1,146
i caused my dad to have a breakdown because of my bulimia and i feel terrible about it i had never heard my dad cry before last night when he had a breakdown about my eating disorder i feel awful he was in the military for the first half of my life and although he is kind and loving he does not show much emotion like ever i had never seen him she would a single tear until yesterday he went on about how he does not want me to die young he just wants me to get better he talked about how he cannot stand to see me hurting myself and that he thinks i should go into treatment he hugged me neither of us are huggers i feel terrible that i would make him feel this way i do not want to get better for me but i do want to get better for the people i love and care about this shit is just so difficult man i hate hurting people,1,174
breakfast i honestly wish i was a restricter that could skip breakfast but i get dizzy if i do but like even when if i did not i would still eat it to be honest it does invalidate me a bit especially with people who say ugh i just have no appetite in the morning i cannot believe people eat breakfast but i honestly wake up for breakfast without a yogurt bowl i would die,1,75
i do not trust my food scale just a rant i know that it is accurate sometimes but sometimes it shows a lower weight than it should and it is driving me insane i am currently not losing that much weight even though my eating habits are the same as they were before afaik but now i am extremely paranoid that i am just eating way more than i think i am and i hate it,1,76
gained weight and it is actually      helping with gender dysphoria i am afab i do not know if i am nonbinary or whatever but i have always hated how my curves made me look inherently feminine i always felt like my shape takes away my ability to control my gender presentation i have become highly restrictive in an effort to lose any recognisable shape my fear has been that if i gain weight i will gain boobs and waist and a period and become an undeniable woman again amp  x200b recently it is been getting harder and harder to restrict and i can tell that i am reaching the end of my high res stamina as such i realised today that i have gained a bit of weight my arms are a little thicker and my belly is a little softer amp  x200b i thought that i would freak out in this situation but i actually kind of mess with it i was so scared of losing what i can only describe as a scrawny emo boy body but the fat is distributing in a way that i see when gym brothers start bulking fat on my body looked ungendered for the first time ever amp  x200b maybe this is my sign to start a gym rat era and lift weights or smth not in the exercise bulimia way of course is this                    healing,1,234
if i know low restriction inevitably leads to a binge why do i keep doing it well it finally happened i was doing so good for months of low restriction and then yesterday i broke i ate all the things like everything i know this happens when i am low restricting why do i keep repeating this god awful cycle when i know better i feel like i just undid all my work it sounds so ridiculous and disordered that i have to use quotes praying this does not trigger a month long binge phase i do not know why i posted i am just sad and ashamed that i keep repeating this same shit over and over my ed has changed so much over the years it is such a mindfuck i never used to go through cycles like this it was just consistent how has your ed morphed since it began,1,153
hoarding i never really noticed this at all when my disordered habits began however since relapsing in january i started hoarding food snacks in my room to have for later this brings me comfort as 1 no one can eat my safe foods 2 i like feeling like i have a variety of food to choose from which also prevents binge urges and 3 the control i have to not eat any of it outside of my omad this means that one grocery trip can last me multiple weeks and i feel like less of a financial burden too on the other hand it also stresses me out when trying to fit something into my cal limit or having to eat something before it expires do others with mainly restrictive ed s do this,1,134
trigger warning does extreme hunger ever go away without intentional recovery i have been constantly hungry for the last 7 months and it is pure agony i will say i do focus on high protein high fiber etc i do all the things that people say make you feel more full and nothing works i am just not ready to recover and i am petrified to eat freely because i am an actual bottomless pit i could eat eat eat and eat and will not feel full i understand this is a natural reaction my body has to prolonged restriction but am desperately hoping it becomes manageable on its own i guess my question is did it ever just kind of go away after awhile or will i be like this forever i am going insane i feel trapped thank you,1,141
no matter how much i eat i am never full unless i am full on binging so i do not bother anymore anyone else feels like a bottomless pit that cannot stop eating no matter what they do i tried everything i went from 3 meals a day to eating every 4 hours i eat enough protein fats and fiber i drink plenty of water i tried cutting carbs and then adding them back did not make a difference i am always hungry like i did not eat literally five minutes before the only thing that worked for me is taking glp 1 injections it felt like i could finally eat like a normal person it caused me so many bad digestive side effects but at least i was finally able to experience fullness what is wrong with me it feels like my body is broken i cannot be full unless i am eating a large volume of food it does not matter how much i am eating like for example my family would always buy two large pizzas one for six people and one just for me i would not feel full after eating the whole pizza but i would need to eat the garlic bread and some form of dessert i also get very panicky when i feel hungry because it means i will have to binge nowadays i just do not eat because what is the point of eating if it will not fill you up,1,249
every time i restrict i have weird bowel movements tw talking about my stool so when i was deep in my ed i i never got constipated and had to go to the bathroom like 5 times a day and had really loose stool i have been in recovery used loosely for a while now and my stool has hardened up but every time i restrict even just a meal or two because i do not ever fast and never did i have loose stool and have to go multiple times a day i have not been able to find anything online about this so i was wondering if anyone has any answers thank you so much,1,117
i eat so god damned much in recovery and i am at a healthy weight i have been struggling with atypical ana for about a year now and i have been in recovery for about 5 months and i just eat so much three meals plus snacks and i have always been at a healthy weight and i am continuing to gain weight and i am so scared its never going to stop or i am going to be heavier than i was when this started and i still constantly think about food and i just do not know what is wrong with me i have tried everything high protein balanced meals more fiber and still i have to eat 3 meals pretty heavy snacks god,1,126

can someone help i do not know what is going on but i am really sick and scared ok so uh this is a long story but i am sick af right now from a binge and just want someone here for me even if it is a stranger so i am ftm 21 year old with anorexia duh and something i do is once a week i binge which lately has gotten harder and harder to do without me getting sick and being in a ton of pain in my smaller meals during the binge days today s for breakfast was a pack of soft chocolate chip cookies i ate slowly throughout the night during the times i woke up half asleep after midnight though so it technically counts as the next day and morning once i woke up fully 2 ham and cheese hot pockets and for lunch a big bowl of ramen i ended up shitting my guts out a little after both meals but i waited a good few hours till dinner which is where the real binge started i went to wendy s cuz burgers sounded good and got a baconator 2 double stacks large root beer and a large fry i also got a cinnabon pull apart but by the time i finished my burgers and most of the frys i was really full and could not even look at them by the time i was done i felt incredibly sick ran to the bathroom but someone was in it so i had to go back to my booth i um i ended up puking all over myself multiple times completely destroyed my clothes and had the worst headache and just felt and still feel really bad i made it home somehow stepdad picked me up and i am praying he did not notice the puke all over me i tried to hide it but i do not know if i did a good job i was kind of in the car not talking right my brain just would not connect to the words i guess it is hard to explain i am home now changed and in the guest room cuz i share a room with 2 little kids and i need quiet obviously i told my stepdad i have a migraine and to tell the kids to be quiet i am a little better now that i am home and not in gross clothes anymore oh and uh i do not know if this is important but my last binge was way worse even though in calories i ate less i went out for chinese food dim sum place and ended the night in literally the worst pain of my life i felt really outta it and dizzy spent like awhile in the bathroom there on the floor thinking i was going to puke but never did and by the time i grew the balls to call my stepdad to pick me up it literally felt like something in my stomach was exploding i spent the car ride curled into a ball in the passenger seat and when i got home i just laid on the couch shaking and in pain like i have been hit by a car before and broke my leg in two places and that did not even compare to the pain i felt that night my mom said if i did not feel better by morning she would take me to the doctor luckily the pepto and a rough sleep helped and the next day i was fine if not very drained was even able to go to work that night with no issue,1,617
overshoot people there hey how are you and how you manage to be in overshoot i guess it is hard to recover in a larger body but we can be proud that our body wants to heel and speed of the healing journey with the overshoot i overshooted after month 2 or 3 in recovery and i am now in month 5 if my recovery journey how you all doing,1,70
finances are making me relapse hi folks i have been struggling with a restrictive ed for years and only just a few months ago committed to recovery everything has been going okay ish it is very back and forth unfortunately until recently i work a minimum wage job and can barely afford life as is but i have fallen on very hard times and it is nearly impossible even with state assistance to be able to afford food it is easy to look at my budget and go skipping these meals would help me save money so i can afford my medications and i am so stressed it feels like skipping food is the only way i am going to survive and be able to pay for rent bills medications any advice or tips would be amazing hanging in there the best i can,1,144
crying over cake tomorrow is my birthday and because i am alone in a foreign country without real friends only coworkers and acquaintances i still wanted to make it a special day for myself and bought my favourite flowers candles and a cake it is not even a full cake but just a slice it is my favourite cake and yet here i am already crying over it because i know it has a ton of calories i texted my friend back home and she tried to comfort me saying it is only once a year and it is my special day and i should celebrate myself and i know she is right but i cannot help to feel highly anxious about eating this slice of cake but i also do not want to throw it away or let it rot in the fridge it does not help that at checkout the cashier commented on my body how nice and skinny i looked and that i sure do not have any health problems ahahah i hate this illness,1,178
body looks different in different mirrors okay does anybody else struggle with this because i swear that in my work bathroom i look way bigger than in the mirrors i have at home i do not know whether it is because the angle or what but it is stressing me out so much i woke up this morning feeling skinny and my stomach looked small so i instantly felt happier smh that is once i go to work and use the restroom and as i always do lift up my shirt to body check and i see that it looks like i gained 15 lbs even the pics look different i swear i know that i did not seriously gain weight in the span it took me to drive to work but why does my body look sooo freakin fatplease tell me i am not the only one hoping the mirror at my house is more accurate lol,1,158
i feel like i cannot recover until i have hit rock bottom i have had anorexia for 9 years now and been severely underweight for majority of that time i am just worried that once i start gaining it will look odd on me if that makes sense just because people have seen me so underweight for so long plus i feel like i cannot get better until my body shuts down i just need to know how far i can push my body before i choose recovery does anyone else feel like this,1,94
well   i think it finally happened today was the first day i felt like i do not even like food that much anymore throughout this whole journey i have yearned and craved a lot of different foods stayed up late at night looking at peoples meals on instagram or cooking videos on tiktok   craving the food they were making not just on a physical level but an emotional level today i had two meals and was like okay it even started to feel gross chewing it up in my mouth mashed chunks sliding down my throat and feeling heavy in my stomach shrinking your stomach is real and its not as cute as i assumed it would be now i just feel way fuller faster which makes it seem like i am eating so much it was a jarring moment its like a video game and i played the same levels over and over and over again and finally beat the boss level and now i have unlocked the second tier levels which are way scarier this is not a humble brag i am still extremely insecure about my body this is about the mental aspect of ed do you guys still like food,1,204
scales ruined my day i have been restricting and purging as i usually do i had one binge over easter but i have just weighed myself and i have not lost weight at all i feel like my day is ruined and i am panicking now as i have maintained my weight even though i am not eating properly it makes me feel like how can i ever eat normal if that means i will gain a ton of weight i feel sick over it so much stress and constantly thinking about it,1,93
want to get wasted because i am having the worst day but alcohol has calories ugh sucks nothing to add feel free to vent about your day,1,27
i am gen terrified n i have noone to go too the past id say month or so i really fell off restricting more of just eating normally or closer to maintence mostly extreme hunger partly because i have a cis bf and loosing my period is really stressful i was gt  108  lt lbs not my goal but i was getting there i js weighed myself granted i have eaten and water weight n everything and it read gt  119  lt i hate everything right now and i am shaking i am so scared praying its water weight since i have been puffier recently and have not shit in a few days i know i probably gained and i was ready ti accept that but not that much i cqnt live like this this disease is a parasite,1,139
restrict and binge cycle i am 16 with an ed this year has been my worst ed relapse and i have been restricting for months now and its led me to this insane cycle of just binging and then restricting i feel so ashamed of myself when i lose control and when i restrict its like i find peace and control within my life and sometimes i use it as a tool to punish myself like if i feel disappointed in my academic achievements i end up restricting as a punishment no one in my life knows about my ed because i truly am so so ashamed of myself and embarrassed but a lot of people around me have been asking questions and what not and becoming suspicious i am just wondering if its truly possible to get out of this cycle i have never once truly had a healthy relationship with food since i developed a disordered mind at around 9 10 years old so i have just been living like this for most of my life,1,178
how do i deal with exercise urges i feel like shit when i do not exercise do i continue to do it or do i try to distract myself,1,29

got prescribed olanzapine for obsessive thoughts i should not have looked it up on reddit all everyone talks about is the weight gain i am fucking terrified but i need to get better my psychiatrist prescribed it because i was experiencing racing thoughts about my weight body image food and so on and it is been crowding my mind to the point where i cannot focus on anything else or be productive he put me on a low dose 2 5mg and did mention weight gain could be a possible side effect but that it only happens on higher doses the experiences people have shared on reddit do not corroborate that though i cannot really tell from comments if the weight gain is inevitable or if the side effect is really just a surge in appetite nevertheless i need to get my shit together because my grades have dropped due to this stupid ed and i am already speaking with my uni to get a deadline extension on my assignment that i just have not been able to do for the last few weeks if you have been prescribed olanzapine what was your experience,1,194
i have not had my period for 3 years now due to ed how detrimental is this to my fertility whenever i brought this up with a gp they dismiss it i am 21 i do not want anorexia forever i need a kick up the ass to keep me motivated,1,51
how to stop purging i do not binge but last year i started purging and i have not been able to go more than a week without purging at least once except when i was inpatient at one point i was doing it daily and multiple times a day then i was able to reduce it but now i feel like the behavior is creeping back up i am not sure how to stop it,1,75
overshot weight has anyone else s weight overshot compared to their pre ed weight while in recovery this is triggering me so bad ugh,1,24
is anyone else undateable listen i am very self conscious about my actions and myself in general which is a problem already i am aware i am pretty and intimidating i consider myself a terrible person with a shit personality disorder that once most people realize i have bpd they go away and its kind of understandable bpd people get so satanized that do not really get empathy from other people perhaps that is not the point of this rant but other that feeling the need to justify yourself to others about the way you are do not you all feel like a walking red flag or sum for some context i went on a date with this cute girl i met on bumble we had a really good time and none of us wanted to leave by the end she told me she struggles with some anxiety and depressive problems and i was like oh me too and the conversation turned around mental health and stuff so i told her that i have bpd ocd traits and the obvious anorexia but that i do not let that define my personality and who i am as a person that is similar as if i was diabetic or something like that that yes its part of me but it does not make me less human or deserving of love too she congratulated me on opening about it because she understood its a hard thing to talk about and that she was happy i am on treatment we kept talking about random stuff and by the end of the date she asked me if we could hang again which i said yes just to get ghosted by the next two days and it makes me wonder it was because i said i am mentally ill that maybe she thought i was those kind of girls that make anorexia their entire personality and i would manipulate her and shit i am not looking for a saviour its my own journey and i am trying to heal without having to involve anyone yk people tends to idealise others on dating apps and its hard to me to explain that yeah i have scars all around my body and that is why i have not removed my jacket and that i am a walking chopstick because people do get disappointed when they see me and this situation has happened multiple times and i do not open about my struggles to everyone as soon as we meet i wait to get kind of close because is like i have to give them a warning and even though i do not say anything they notice that there is something wrong with me judging by my body or they get to see one of my scars when i move they do get disgusted i have asked my friends multiple times what is wrong with me and they say they do not understand why i am single if i am an awesome person even though i deal with some problems but that does not define me so why i am undateable i try to act normal in public i order normal food so i do not out myself so maybe i am just disgusting the idea of dating a bulimic motherfucker makes them want to die,1,557
how did you stop counting calories i am currently in ed recovery but i cannot seem to manage to not count calories it kind of refrain me in my recovery because i can see how much i ate and might restrict a bit because of it i do not know how to stop and how to motivate myself to stop i am scared that if i do not count i will just eat too much so i wanted to hear you all advices on how to stop counting them also how did you reassured yourself that you were not eating too much,1,102
everyone is dieting around me and i am losing my fucking sanity at work i first noticed a lady who came back from maternity leave shredding in front of my eyes she is very private about it but the change is very noticable no one dares to comment because she seems mean and cold but in reality she is a sweetheart but my coworkers talk and it makes me want to compete with her at weight loss another coworker however called herself a pig many times jokingly fyi she was not fat probably the higher end of normal but never fat and lost a significant amount of weight and very open about it as we are kind of workplace buddies she never miss a chance to tell me that her sister is making fun of her as her ass disappeared or that she had to bring her uniform into a tailor to make it smaller because she lost so much weight and even the tailor was suprised that her uniform is so much bigger now she really got smaller but i cannot say a word as she is not doing this on purpose she is happy about her weight loss and has every right to be happy about it but the oversharing triggers me so much and summons my worst personality like i saw her eating a kfc meal today and literally waited until everyone left and dig it from the trash to see what size of fries she had what kind of meat she had and oh my god she had the 3 sauce combo and all of it was garlic mayo counted it immediately and felt so good because it is so much calories and she will not continue to lose weight if she started to eat like this again than i realised how fucked up it is like who the hell dig into trash to track someone else s meal and think like this and i was really ashamed of myself there are two others who are besties i overheard them for like 2 months now not eating dairy not eating anything with flour in it and i was making notes in my head like no dairy except for yoghurt yoghurt bowls are my everything now no pastries my other coworker today asked if they wanted some sweets he baked them himself and asked everyone and while i just said not now thank you one of them said no i cannot eat summer is coming you know and felt such an overwhelming guilt for eating today that i approached this women ever though i rarely talked to her and sneakily asked for her weight for hear goal what kind of rules she follow just to make sure i am better at it and she was excited and happy to anwsver i hate this i want to scream whenever i hear other people restricting themselves or losing weight no matter if it is on purpose or not like it is supposed to be my thing you are not allowed to be better at it,1,516
when do i eat lunch tomorrow i have a bit of a problem which i really need some advice for recently i have been looking into the best times to eat and decided to start eating lunch earlier i am a really slow eater so i start lunch at around 12 1 and finish at around 2 3 while also doing something else like studying of course cannot be too focused on a meal however tomorrow i have to go out to drop some things off at 12 30 and then i have a meeting at 1 i am not sure how long it will last but let us say i am able to start lunch at 2 30 that will probably take me up to after 4 which feels too late the other option is eating during the meeting which would be allowed but involves eating in front of someone i just do not know what to do,1,159
i feel like i am a reason as to why one of my partners relapsed in their ed and i do not know what to do triggering topic mentionned there is my bmi in the post i think i can put an alert for fatphobia as well i do not really know if there is anything else but please read this with caution avoid all of this if you are mentally in a dark place it is not worth it to start i nb 19 is with two wonderful partners both 20 nb as well i have an eating disorder since over a decade now on the binge side the partner mentionned here also have one i cannot tell since how long on the restrictive side with breaks and my other partner seems to have some disordered eating to some degree that i noticed but i might be wrong on that one anyway lately my partner is in a huge relapse to the point of physically injuring themselves as a way to purge not only this is heartbreaking on it is own but it is worse when i might be a motivation for them in a i do not want to be like it  way for context i am medically obese bmi of 40 mainly because of my daily binges over the years both of them are aware of it it has never been an issue whatsoever in our relationship since the begining however i noticed that recently i recieve from my partner more weird spikes about my body i mean it does happen to have them from time to time about my sweating issue hyperhidrosis that was and still is really distressing to me in ways i will not explain but i know that it is mostly mistakes and a bad way lf communicating things that appears to be harsh rude and that i am oversensitive lmao but that time it is different this week end i got for the first time a remark on my body as it is and not its reactions i do not remember exactly what was said either that i had a fat face or have my face full of fat maybe both i did not expected that at all i do not even remember the context for this i remember that they said right after whatever i responded that it was just a fact which it is but like i do not need a verbal reminder of what i see in the mirror everyday when i barely dare to look at myself i do not know if i am overthinking this i may be after all i cannot trust my judgment because of mental illness but to me it is odd that they are the only one doing this my partner does not mishappen like this with me and they do not say things like that to our partner i feel like they are projecting their issue onto me and i feel even more disgusting than before my potential awareness to me i just nerf their ed unwillingly and i do not want that if i do it must be because we see each other so much that we basically almost live all together and since we all eat the same things maybe their brain made the connexion between our food and my body that if they continue to eat they will end up like me at that point my existence is some kind of trigger to them but it also does trigger me it genuinely makes me want to die to express my guilt but with those circumstances i cannot discuss with any of my partners about it it feels wrong to bring up my feelings when i am not the one trully suffering in that case just by proxy it is like taking all the spotlight for something that is not even about me i am also scared to be so wrong about everything and just mess everything up making things even worse for everyone whenether it be by the ed flairing up or an argument things like that i need clarification and help about it thanks to anyone reading this what i wrote might make no sense i am sorry in advance,1,712
it feels like the 2010s again and i think i am going to go insane why is every single celebrity getting stick thin why is everything on mainstream media ab weight or food or exercise why is literal pro ana shit back online and on mainstream regular people media where they do not eve realize what the origin is i keep seeing people talk like they did back in 2014 16 i keep people slimming down so quickly i do not know if i can deal with it for a second time and this time with fucking ozempic and the crazy ass surgeries and everything amp  x200b i cannot even go a day without hearing some shit ab diet or exercise and its not even healthy shit anymore it is literally ed equivalent shit which is the most insane thing to me how are we back at the same place we began and its so fucking suffocating like at least since 2019 i could not deal with food weight talk outside of my brain but now its back to being inside and outside of my brain i cannot honestly i seriously cannot do this again,1,195
lost today has been so stressful i had a big outburst and was being so hateful to my family all because they wanted to go out around my dinner routine and it scared me i was so mean and i realized in the moment that this is not okay they should not have to abide by my eating disorder or fear the random anger outburst when all they want is for me get better and have a good time i cried in my mom and nieces arms tonight because i am so tired of it i just wish things were different i really need to really look into recovery frl this time i know it will be scary but the idea of me not being here with them is scarier,1,130
hair falling out more in recovery i have been in recovery for a month now and already at a healthy weight due to extreme hunger at the beginning but now my hair is falling out in big clumps in the shower and i am terrified because the one thing i have been complimented on my whole life is my hair it is very thick and naturally pink straight does anyone know why this is happening i am so scared,1,79
i need a genuine opinion hello there this is going to be extremely long but it would mean the world to me if you could read it and tell me what you think    i am just so lost and i desperately need an outsiders point of view tw i will be mentioning explicit numbers and calories i am 16 and alone in every sense of the word i have had an eating disorder since i was 10 i will give you a brief summary of the stages of my ed at first it was binge eating i was ten and overweight so you can imagine all the bullying i got from school family but i will be referring to that later summer started and in like two months i lost gt  16kg  lt i became what you would say normal looking leaning towards thin i gained some of the weight later but i also became taller i am 1 73cm currently so to this day i have never been considered as fat by people again then a circle of binge eating and restricting started bulimia by overexercising in the gym in order to eat something i liked and not feel guilty i have never thrown up though but not because i have not tried just because i literally cannot then restricting began again i was maybe 13 i would be eating like an apple a day but that situation did not last very long because my mother was constantly up my neck and she would be crying saying i would go to the hospital and blah blah blah    it was unbearable so i began to eat normally then binge eating started again gained some weight but it did not show because i was getting taller for five months i had very few binge eating episodes highschool started two months in stuff happened and i became incredibly depressed i lost like gt  5kg  lt maybe and then for some reason when i started to get mentally a bit better i gained gt  18kg  lt in 7months i think second class of highschool began stuff happened again and i would binge eat every other day my weight remained stable though because i would try again and compensate in the gym i was gt  88kg  lt 2 5 months ago now i am gt  74kg  lt i overrestrict eating most days gt  380 480kcal  lt at first it was higher but as my body started to adjust i lowered my calorie intake then i will binge again and for the next two days i will drink only liquids but i am losing weight it is been gt  14kg  lt so far i do not want comments telling me about the dangers and all that because i know everything literally for these past two months i have been obsessively researching reading articles and all that so i am aware of all the longterm stuff that could happen to me if i keep this up but i simply cannot do otherwise i feel like i know what i am doing and i know that someone who does not know what he is doing would say that but i swear that i will eventually stop and then slowly ease my calories back up because i do not want to become underweight and be sick from anorexia moving to my family my father is the healthiest person i know for the past three decades he has been so so so so obsessed with healthy eating i cannot even describe it but he has anger issues and is very toxic even though i know that yes he loves me i will be mentioning some of the things he has said to me that have been extremely triggering and have basically fueled my ed we were having a family dinner in a restaurant we were around 10 people i was 13 then after i had lost the weight and i was actually feeling kind of okay about my body i was thin just not the my bones stick out kind of thin anyway my uncle suddenly said that i could become a model if i wanted to i laughed and said i was not interested and guess what my father suddenly blurts out she could but she would have to lose gt  10kg  lt first the way i felt my face heat up everyone was silent 5 min later i felt my lower lip starting to tremble and i knew that i would burst out crying i excused myself went to the bathroom and bawled my eyes out it was so embarrassing because everyone knew why i had really went another time we were arguing about something completely irrelevant and guess what he says again and i would want you to be gt  5kg  lt lighter but what can we do now he would also always refer to the weight i had to lose as lambs mind you again that was when i was relatively thin as funny as that may sound he was serious he would say you have two three lambs left to lose referring to the weight of each lamb something about that extremely triggered me flashback to when i was 10 before losing the weight i remember i had went to the hairdresser and straightened my hair for the first time ever and i was so excited i went to my father and asked him if he liked it and i do not remember his exact words but basically it was not really because your face looks more chubby now yup or we were at the beach him me my grandma and brother a very skinny girl passes by my grandma comments look at how thin she is her bones stick out my dad says that is the nice thing your bones sticking out when it comes to my mother she was not that bad after i lost the weight and whenever i expressed i wanted to lose more she would say that i was already skinny and should not but still she made comments about my food sometimes and triggered me like are you going to eat all that you do not have to eat it all if you do not want to making me feel embarrassed so never eating it all give me half of it so you do not have to eat it all while everyone else was eating normally my mum has a very high metabolism and never gains weight then a comment my grandmother made when i was 10 really haunts me to this day you should really lose the weight because when you walk down the street with your mum everyone will be thinking how big you are and you will stick out also when i was 10 kids were brutal why what did they gain from their comments whale mind of a kid in a body of an ox or calling me fat and me turning my head and them saying so you knew we were referring to you the list is endless my parents have been divorced by the way since i was 9 for the first 8 years of my life i lived in place a then we moved 12h away in place b my dad left after one year going back to place a with my mum and brother we stayed in place b for 5 years then went to place c i stayed with them for two years but like i mentioned before stuff happened and i could not stay there anymore this year i moved by myself back to place a i live with my grandmother who is also very very toxic but less toxic than my dad and kind of the same toxic as my mother but in different ways i have never felt so invalidated before and i do not know if i even have the right to feel that my grandmother is one of these people that say others have it worse for example we were talking the other day and she said something that she has never had any problems with eating unlike me and i said yeah well you did not have a father whose his main life goal was getting you to be thin and constantly commenting on your weight at first she says your dad comments on my weight all the time but you do not see me acting like this and i respond i think it is a very different situation considering i was ten and you are a seventy four year old woman and since she had lost her point she went with the classical other people get beaten by their father or plenty of other times she has said your parents could be drug addicts or drunks but they are not the thing is i feel so guilty feeling bad about anything and everything i literally cannot live with myself keep in mind that nobody in my family is aware of the extent of my eds and how screwed my mind is actually they think that i am overreacting and that my mind does not deserve to feel like that because nothing has happened to me they just know that i am restricting some times and others i just eat normally if only it were that simple they do not know about the rotten foods and all that also when my dad comes by and sees me some times he will congratulate me about the weight i have lost these past months and tell me how noticeable it is but he must know that i am not doing it healthily so why is he congratulating me he knows i do not exercise and thus how else could anyone lose gt  14kg  lt in two and something months plus i have adhd and i do not really know about the relation it has with food but i just thought i would mention it i am so angry all the time and it will not stop i am so angry when i see food i cannot eat and especially when i see skinny girls eating i hate them so passionately it is so unfair why can they eat so much and still remain so thin i am so alone no friends and i am constantly so hurt i feel unlovable and undeserving of anything i will never be picked and i know that i will always be alone i just do not know yet how to embrace that loneliness i feel like the only hope for me is to be patient for another year until i leave for university and live alone and in peace this was long and i am so very sorry but there was so much to unpack if you beared with me and read this please tell me your honest opinion,1,1820
i want to recover but i have no idea where to start does anyone know of any good free resources to help with ed shit i cannot keep living like this but my mum is the least emotionally intelligent person on the planet and i am too poor to get therapy i seriously need help or i am going to die at this rate i do not know how to fix this anymore i do not want to be skinny anymore i do not care i want to stop giving a shit about food again i never used to care i was not overweight i have ruined my life and i want it back i cannot keep going like this i cannot sleep or eat properly i cannot think about anything but food and nothing satisfies me anymore,1,138
today sucks ass i did not weigh myself this morning because i could not go but then i did as soon as i got to work yknow away from my scale where i will not have access to it for hours so naturally i decide to not eat until i can get home except there is a new chip flavor that i reallyyy wanted to try n i am really hungry n ill just eat the serving size maybe not even its fine i ate half the bag i freaked out i have never done this before but i was so upset about ruining my plans that i went to the employee bathroom to purge and i could not do it i just dry heaved n dribbled a little why tf can my fingers go back so far and nothing happens i could not look at myself in the mirror when i washed my hands tried to purge at work n could not even do it right i felt so gross n embarrassed walking out i have a package of sugar free wafers last time i ate them i immediately got the runs super bad that is the plan tonight but the way today is going ill just bloat up instead i just want a flat stomach for an event tomorrow fuck,1,222
why are therapists so triggering i am technically not seeing her for ed related stuff but omfg this is the second therapist i have had out of three who has said triggering shit when it comes to my body the first one i had was even worse i was specifically seeing her for a restrictive ed and she was basically giving me weight loss tips telling me smoothies with protein are great for weight loss and not to eat too much sugar and that if i did things in a healthy way i could get back down to my lw and ugw this next one it was just a little comment i was talking about my bdd with my face and she was asking about my body and i brought up how despite not working out much for a few months due to asthma i would lost a few pounds she immediately said well that is definitely just muscle loss then not actual fat like wtf now i am soooo triggered and cannot stop thinking about how i disturbed my fat to muscle ratio or whatever,1,186
i am finally doing it i am actually consistently eating more after probably a year of saying i would and putting it off i am having a hard time but i am doing it i am not ready for recovery but i know my body at least needs harm reduction i am so fucking proud of myself i am also slowly branching out and trying fear foods and i ate in a restaurant for the first time in years tiny bites for now with fear foods but it is a start i had a small bite of peppermint bark and was hit with so much nostalgia i have cookie dough in the fridge that i am going to try one day with my mom,1,124
i feel incapable does anyone else feel like they physically cannot throw up and look i understand the whole do not go down that path but yeah i do not know if just mentally it is not something i entirely want to do or well i do not know i just cannot the second i feel anything rise in my throat i instantly swallow even triggering gag reflex does nothing and i cannot imagine at all actually throwing up from that i am terrified to actually throw up even if i feel sick i cannot make it happen am i just not trying hard enough i hate vom with a passion i hate the idea of it and anything related to it other than the thought of getting rid on what is inside of me its frustrating,1,137
does anyone else go back and forth between feeling skinny and fat for context i am not underweight but i am far for being overweight either there are days when i look in the mirror and all i see is fat and flab or my old obese body i feel so incredibly big and i feel embarrassed to go out or wear form fitting clothes but then when i actually go out and or meet people i have not met in a while i get told that i look sick and that i should start eating more and for a moment their words start to seem real and the bones start to feel a bit more visible as compared to the flab but shortly after that fat feeling comes back and i feel so incredibly ashamed of believing their words and then i start to feel like i am being messed with and lied to and that i am actually fat and flabby,1,163
upped my intake to get my period back no period gained weight laughing out loud i started to up my intake by a good amount because i wanted my period back instead i gained an appetite weight uncontrollable hunger and no period fml someone please help,1,46

first binge ever hi guys started my period today and i have been eating normally over the weekend after a period of restriction i was main ting weight so i felt all good and then today all of a sudden i have uncontrollable hunger and i binged gt  3000  lt cal and the scales gone up gt  5 pounds  lt i am seriously freaking out because it is taken me back to gt  normal weight bmi  lt i have never lost control like this before ever and i am feeling so scared also so stressed right now due to deadlines and i am going to have to fast for two days but i fear i do not have the strength for it i am just feeling so stupid like i have ruined all my progress also in extreme physical discomfort right now i have no clue what to do and wish i could just rewind it all,1,157
me calling different periods of my ed eras rather than admitting it is all part of the binge restrict cycle i was in my skinny era before but now i am back to my binging era this was all extremely predictable,1,41
help needed for loved one one of my friends went through a nasty break up and is now severely underweight she struggled with eating disorders in the past she is not admitting to having one now and is blaming it on medication for all i know she could be right but all the signs are there how do i lovingly tell her i am worried about her and want her to get better i know it is a very very sensitive subject,1,82
my bf feeds into my ed in a strange way so my boyfriend will basically say things like eat a cheeseburger or you are just a sack of bones which i am not like super underweight he knows i want to hear those things in a way but he says them in this way that makes me feel like he is joking because i am clearly not anorexic enough i do not know i do not know,1,77
losing weight while having an ed i have ednos and i have been relatively average to chubby my whole life my eating disorder causes me to drastically lose and gain huge amounts weight i am trying to find an inner peace and a healthy enough way to lose weight i am a little bit overweight and build confidence while also not trigger myself into starving i want to be able to diet like a healthy person but it is really fucking difficult to not trigger myself lately i started moving my body more and i am trying to focus on intuitive eating and understanding my body i hope anyone who is going through the same thing finds the same peace of mind and balance i am searching for lt 3,1,130
struggling day after b p the day after a bad b p is always so hard for me like i spent the entire day binging and purging yesterday and ultimately did not keep any normal meals down do any of you guys have a really hard time going back to normal eating the next day my stomach is screwed up and i am having urges to purge anything i am eating now the sensation of anything in my stomach gives me such bad anxiety amp it is like a trauma thing for me wanting to feel empty so this is even harder right now i do not know i just needed to vent i guess i have to power through this but rationally i know i did a number on my body yesterday so it is all out of whack trying to digest food now,1,145
birthday party tomorrow is a birthday party of my friend the timings are difficult to cope bcoz they coincide with my workout time means dinner at a time i am not comfy with i will not be able to workout and will have alot of calorie dense foods i do not know what to do,1,55
i feel bad for influencers who build their platforms on their weight loss i mean it is none of my business but it cannot possibly be mentally healthy to be constantly discussing that right like for me personally it would be a fast track to body obsession and downward spiraling i was just scrolling on tiktok and came across some guy sharing a recipe that helped him loose xx big amount of pounds and i was curious so i went to look at his page and he is built a decent following with every one of his videos being about his eating habits tips and tricks for weight loss etc which is all fine and well but what happens when if he or any influencer in that niche for that matter gains weight which lbr is a very natural thing that happens like i imagine they must be under an extreme amount of pressure to look skinny at all times and that already how much it can fuck you up to have been overweight at any point i feel is a recipe for disaster and disordered thoughts and habits i do not know that this guy or any specific influencer have an eating disorder and i am not looking to armchair diagnose but building a brand on food and body obsession just seems so sad i wonder how or if they can balance that at all mentally like are they just constantly thinking about food their body distant chants of one of us one of us are they ok with being known as the person who lost x amount of weight i would not be lmao i know this is not some novel realization but it was on my mind i guess,1,292
ik it is a mental illness but also i feel like a bad person for adhering to beauty standards and wantíng to be as small as possible it just feels icky i do not want to be desireable i do not want people to think i am performing femininity i do not want to be underweight for the patriarchy but it feels difficult to get around that and avoid it we live in a society and whatever but i feel sick thinking about men thinking i am good because i am skinny i want to bite their heads off for thinking about me but i do not want to gain weight i am so afraid of gaining weight and that makes me feel like i am failing feminism would i still have anorexia if this was not the beauty standard would i still be this obsessed with my weight if it was just as desireable to be fat am i really anorexic or am i just being a good woman thinking about it makes me want to die,1,178
hungry all the time hey guys i am recently trying to restore some weight that i lost due to a relapse and the extreme hunger is making me feel so shitty all the time i try so hard to eat big meals and honor my hunger but it feels so hard to do when i am literally hungry every 10 minutes it is the worst at my job because i cannot eat until my breaks and will have to go hours without food making me feel like absolute dog shit does anyone have any tips on what foods or supplements help with this extreme hunger i am so desperate i just want to feel like a normal human again,1,119
food makes me nauseous i have been restricting food like a lot i pretty much do not eat during the day and at night i have something like a salad i have lost about 30 pounds and recently i have been having this problem where food that used to be delicious to me makes me so nauseous i feel like i am going to throw up and also feel like i am going to cry food i used to love disgusts me because i feel like it is going to make me gain weight i do not even feel anymore like i have to fight the urge to indulge myself it just all physically grosses me out and makes me feel like sick this is just new for me because i have always been able to at least enjoy the food even if i felt bad about it like for lunch yesterday with my dad everything was high in calories so i ordered a side of hummus and pita it looked delicious but as soon as i saw it i felt like i was going to vomit does this happen to anybody else,1,193
not my mom watching a news story about binge eating oh god oh fuck please do not pay close attention to it do not mention purging please aaaa they are talking about binge restrict cycles too i am embarrassed sorry for eating your food இ இ,1,46

could i get my period hello as the title suggests i am wondering if its possible for me to get my period i am a teen and my ed unfortunately started before i ever even got my period i am currently pretty severely underweight gt   bmi 15   lt which ik is bad but i am still a teenager so its not as bad as if i were an adult i have attempted recovery several times over the past couple of years but relapsed and am currently semi recovering and maintaining my weight under parental and medical supervision and eating gt  1500 1700  lt calories i eat a very healthy diet and am trying to focus on eating lots of healthy fats i have heard of people around my bmi and even lower sometimes getting their periods but ik that is very rare and probably will not happen i want to recover in the future but it seems impossible right now,1,160
avoidant restrictive eating disorder i knew i was having problems with food it is been very hard for me since the new year with everyone trying to lose weight for the new year it made me feel gross or disgusting for wanting food which has led to me avoiding it restricting myself every single day i recently was talking about my therapist and she told me about avoidant restrictive eating disorder and how i am bordering anorexia what does this mean for me do i talk to my friends about this i do not know how to go about this i want to do research but do not want to trigger myself any further or upset myself more making it harder for me to heal this week she asked me to bring a granola bar to work she said i do not have to eat it i did buy granola bars and i have one in my purse but i do not think i can eat it does anyone have any tips or just words of understanding encouragement,1,178
tw anybody else restrict to not become more attractive but to take up less space i personally restrict my food intake to become smaller so i will not take up more apace than i need and attract attention to myself i do not care if i have the summer ready body or whatever else nonsense kids are on these days i know i am not beautiful and i do not desire to be,1,73
i was recovered for years until now a few years ago my family helped me recover and develop a healthier mindeset overall that was until recently i feel super bad about my body my thighs are way too big and i am becoming convinced i have cellulite my breasts are bigger which sucks because i am also transgender and my body looks more feminine than before recovery today is really when everything shattered we went out to get some ice cream which i enjoyed but what really triggered me was how my brother said he wanted to eat something for dinner so we drove for a while and the only options were mostly fast food he said i am not hungry anymore let us just go home but we ended up going to firehouse subs because my mom and dad were just getting something for themselves my brother and i ended up being pressured into ordering something so we would not be hungry later once we got home he went straight to his room without eating and i did the same my parents began expressing concern over whether or not he would eat anything and i have this big problem over needing permission to eat or just being forced to eat so if nothing is said i immediately think i am fat and i should starve i feel like this is when my eating disorder starts coming back again,1,239
i feel like a ticking time bomb its been a month since i last did this i swore i would not do it again but tonight i lost it i tried to purge earlier and i do not feel good nothing came out but i felt sick i swore to myself and to god i would not do it again why is this so difficult why cannot i just stop this i feel addicted to it  when i am not doing it for days and weeks i feel like i am just waiting till i eventually give in  like a ticking time bomb no one knows about my ed i know they will make me feel bad for it my purging has caused me to have chronic gingivitis they are painful and my gums bleed a lot i do not wish this on anyone at all  and i hope i can finally stop without thinking of doing it again ever,1,160
why is my brain like this i am hungry i just want a snack but if i do i will hate myself apologies for this mini rant i just hate my brain and this disease i am fine during the day i can restrict no problem but then evenings can be hell i am so hungry tonight i know i restricted a lot today and could eat something but i just feel i do not deserve it i hate this i hate overthinking every fucking thing checking calories and just hating myself no matter what i do,1,97
i think my healthy brain is taking over my ed brain and i do not know how to fight it i have been having such a hard time fighting cravings and i keep giving in i feel so much more out of control than i used to just a couple months ago i was able to restrict as much as i wanted now it feels impossible sometimes i know this is supposed to be a good thing because it means i am getting healthier but its so hard because all i want to do is hold onto my ed because its the only thing that makes me feel good about my body also i expressed to myy friend that i felt like i gained some weight and she responded that i look healthy anyone with an ed knows that calling us healthy does not make us feel good,1,148
cold hands what causes it i got blood work done recently and had my hormones and thyroid checked my doctor said my results were all normal so it made me curious other than things like low iron or thyroid issues what causes very cold hands,1,45
so excited i found a low calorie nondairy icecream i have never found one in the wild before cannot have dairy so i cannot do halo top i am so fucking excited for this,1,34
i cannot stop eating i literally cannot stop eating it is such a problem i went from my lw back up to my sw and i still cannot stop eating i do not even feel like i have been restricting that much even before i started gaining back the weight i am supposed to be getting assessed for an ed soon finally after 3 years and i feel like they are going to tell me i am fine because i have gained all the weight back but i literally do not feel full anymore right now i do not know what it is i used ti be able to stop myself after having a meal or at least decrease the amount of food i had after having a meal maybe it is because i am not having any proper meals right now and it is all just stuff i can find around the kitchen like literally just random food combinations á la ingredient household snack food but still it is literally killing me inside it is the fact i cannot even buy any normal food to prepare and i have to rely on my family to buy food that i will actually be able to turn into a proper meal but that is entirely dependent on if they feel like it i feel guilty enough eating eating the food they buy as it is but my binging every month when i get my paycheck means i run out of my own food very quickly you can probably imagine but oh my god i cannot deal with the not feeling full it literally just gets to a point where i have to force myself to stop eating because i cannot just keep eating until the kitchen runs out of food,1,299
i have been in recovery so long that it feels like i cannot relapse even if i try i feel terrible for thinking this was but i just wanted to get it off my chest share and see if anyone ever feels the same i have been in recovery for 2 years yay genuinely yay this illness takes so much for you and i am so glad i have gotten better the ed voice and thoughts i once had have gotten quieter and less frequent and i am also weight restored to a weight higher than before my ed which makes sense because i have grown and aged a few years however i am not completely happy with my body and sometimes the voice tells me to relapse and even if i try to slightly restrict my food i cannot my body punishes me so much now when i try to even restrict lightly and that invalidates me and makes me feel like i was never really eating disordered at all and i did it all for attention a phase has anyone ever experienced this it is frustrating because i do not want to relapse but the fact my body will not allow me anymore triggers me and puts me back into that mindset anyone relate any tips to stop feeling this way,1,223
does anyone else heart palpitation during the deed like bro we will being doing it and my heart starts beating so hard and it is low key painful asf and then we have to stop and i end up needing to take a break to catch my breath it is literally ruined everything,1,53

best foods for when the urge to binge comes up not just asking for straight up binge food recs but just foods that sort of satisfy the urge to binge without spending absurd amounts of money every time can be foods that will curb the binge but also foods you can substitute for binge foods that you can eat a lot of without it being unhealthy i know eating regularly is the best watching avoid binging but i do not think that is going to happen right now i am about to go into another binge phase payday and want to try and not go bankrupt,1,106
my biggest fear is that seeing a therapist will make me fat i want help but i do not want to gain weight so i do not know what to do because i feel like if i was truly ready for recovery i would be willing to gain the weight which i am not i need advice please lt 3,1,60
i am getting sent to a residential unit for the first time i am begging for advice i am pretty young still and have not been to any treatments away from home things have gotten bad enough to where my caregivers admitted me to a residential treatment center it is because my weight has not gone up and i do not know what to do i had anorexia growing up and and morphed to bulimia and the vomiting has gotten worse i know it is not good but i do not know how to stop i try to eat normally but i feel if i do not eat my safe foods anything out of that i will gain weight i come from a background of running and crossfit and i love it to death the vomiting happened after the gym got token away from me any advice on how i should go about this i leave in 2 days,1,159
kinder to myself than ever but i relapsed i am so much kinder to myself my internal monologue is friendlier i do not hate myself beat myself up over going over my calorie limit i do not shame myself for having to miss a workout but it is twisted because i relapsed into my anorexia i will overeat and instead of beating myself up about it i just tell myself i will restrict more the next day gt   or fast which is worse    lt and it is almost like i am being kinder because i am not literally bullying myself like i did the first time around,1,107
should i tell my psychiatrist i have been struggling with disordered eating for about five years now it is gotten a lot worse and i have not told a mental health professional about it before i want to tell my psychiatrist to try and get an official diagnosis but i am not really sure if i would receive one i also do not really want my parents finding out should i mention it at my next appointment,1,77
returning to work after treatment i am going back today after being gone a month and a half i was supposed to be gone double this time but i discharged ama everything is different and i am no longer needed because of course i am not this would not be so heartbreaking for me if i had more going on in my life you know like family and friends and an actual life i am terrified the weight gain is huge the bloat is severe and i ended up binging purging the last 2 nights despite my recovery i worry about physical side effects my digestion is fucked and i am often in some level of pain i am genuinely not sure how ill hold up i am also unsure of when during my shift i will actually be able to eat i do get a half hour break but eating in front of others is a non option especially now that my weight is so high i am ashamed and self conscious and really anxious it might be fine i hope it is fine pray for me please,1,189
does anyone else think of their period as a reason not to recover i got my period super late at 16 right around when i developed my ed and i have pcos so i never really got used to monthly periods and i just hate it so much i hate cramps and sore boobs i feel disgusting and unclean using pads i feel even worse about sticking anything up there i just hate the whole process of it and i do not even want to have kids but being underweight takes all that away even if it harms my body in so many other ways but my irrational brain prefers that to being healthy amp getting periods,1,117
anyone else here fuck their stomach acid up so badly that you have to take orders from it now i have to tiptoe around not setting the stomach acid off cannot drink things like soda or coconut water or alcohol cannot eat citrus or much sugar if i wait too long to eat it gives me migraines and makes me start throwing up pure acid all i can do then is try to keep protein shake down or i will get stuck vomiting because my stomach is empty with a stomach that is empty because i keep vomiting i have had to go in for iv fluids after 48 straight hours of that cycle never again this is one of those things that not a lot of people talk about here but i doubt i am the only one yknow i do not know if it is from purging or starving or what but it did not used to be like this,1,162

help confused about my disorder i have had diagnosed an for 5 or so years now but in the past few months it is morphed into something different i used to eat almost anything as long as it were below my calories but now i only eat safe foods and the safe foods have to be exactly the same such as i only eat one specific brand flavour of yogurt it is been like this for months i have strong food aversions and get really overwhelmed by new flavours and textures is this still anorexia,1,95
i recently moved in with roommates and my ed has never been worse the biggest thing about this is simultaneously wanting to be included at meal times but getting massive amounts of anxiety about eating in front of other people i really do not know how to cope with my situation would anyone else who has been in a similar situation want to chime in with some advice,1,68

uni boy so there is this dude in my class who i have a not really crush on i asked him out he said no stating that i am not his type he is a very skinny guy so his type is skinny girls i tread that fine line between chubby and fat so basically any way you look at it he just does not find me attractive now obviously you should not change yourself for a guy but stupid ed brain has taken this as a challenge and i want to get really skinny and yk how eds are you think life will suddenly turn around the moment you hit a certain number on the scale and so i think if i lose like gt  20kgs  lt he would want me i do not even want him now but i feel such a strange attachment to him in the sense that he literally feels like my ed personified pleasing him would be pleasing myself him finding me attractive would mean i have done something right he is not really attractive is not nice he is cruel in the way my ed is cruel and i realize how bad this is but yk i am stupid this is such a rite of passage for every 19 y o girl but just ed fied i am deathly attached to a man who wants nothing to do with me,1,237
i have no support system people seem to not care about adults with ed they think that you will grow out of it after 18 i feel so alone in this and it sucks i did have a support system when i was a teenager i made friends on edtumblr and some have grown out of it and some did not it is annoying that i am still dealing with this that is the word i would describe it annoying someone please tell me i am not alone on edtwt a 15 year old told a 25 year old woman that they were a pedophile for being in a community full of teenagers like imagine looking for support and somebody tells you that,1,123
aphagia and esophagus troubles i have been engaging more severely in b p recently and i am back to the point where i cannot swallow easily without liquid assistance and my chest is super tight and it is difficult to breathe at times i am not really looking for advice unless you have it lol more so solidarity i do not know also my throat hurty all the time and i feel like my mouth and face and throat muscles are starting to seize up almost they feel incredibly tight all the time clenched i guess is a better way to describe it hot tea and broth are nice but it is getting hotter here and i do not have ac and because of my circulation i cannot handle the heat i have cough drops but i feel guilty if i have too many during the day zero cal syrup and shaved ice is nice but i do not always have access to the place i go to for that per usual i am just kind of rambling but it is kind of frustrating because if i cannot swallow then no safe foods then i will have to do liquid nutrient and because i am insane my cal limit is low low and anything that is above 100 is so so scary i can barely justify an egg white i can barely justify a piece of gum or gummy vitamins i am just uncomfortable going back to treatment is inevitable unless it actually gets me this time and i know it is getting closer and closer and i do not know it just fucking sucks i hope this is the last time,1,282

my job does not feed me or give me breaks as a punishment so the punishment for being late at my job is that you cannot order food nd they also do not give us a break today i came in late and the first thing they tell me is i cannot have food and i am banned from getting close to the fryers they are literally are the voices in my head but irl nd they know i struggle with an eating disorder like thanks for helping me restrict you guys,1,92
my friend made me eat so much food so today my friend came over to my house my mum had bought pizza for us so when she got hungry she went for pizza but she also got me a slice i tried everything to escape it but she would not let me since she already knew about my anorexia she did let me soak up the grease with paper towel so at least i did that but still she made me eat three fucking slices of pizza along with a bowl of cereal later on i know she was trying to help but i think she over did it i felt sick gt  fat  lt and gross i am scared i gained weight it is really triggering me to over exercise,1,131
welp i relapsed long story short it all started a couple years ago when i lost a ton of weight by starving myself then when i started smoking weed the munchies took over my ed faded to the background and i gained a lot back recently my sister came back into my life and she kept weighing herself talking about how little she eats seeing her not eat which triggered me i guess so i have barely eaten this week and already lost 5kg in 7 days thinking about eating anything makes me feel repulsed i gained way too much weight when i let loose and now i look disgusting and fat again and the fat just needs to be gone as soon as possible,1,125
has anyone purged buldak ramen before never making that mistake again,1,11
i need a hug and a break really badly any kind of comfort is appreciated this post is kind of a vent as well and i apologize in advance for sounding whiny first year of college has been really rough especially after a forced gap year involving fbt treatment i still get nightmares of those times occasionally and it hurts to be kind of scared of my parents and homesick at the same time but longing for the home from pre ed not the home environment since then it is challenging keeping up with outpatient appointments and schoolwork especially since i am taking classes for both math and computer science majors at the same time i am so sleep deprived and mentally fatigued i hardly understand what is going on in linear algebra and programming class and spend 15 hours on each every week lack of sleep really messes with my mood and body image  keeping up with eating is a lot harder i know college is not easy but i hate how dumb i feel and the guilt that comes with not studying even over weekend evenings i am on the verge of crying and mentally breaking down every day i want to lie in bed and nap every afternoon but i still go to every class and force myself to do assignments i have an international internship in the summer but i am tired just tired i miss having free time from my childhood days  recess evenings where i can do extracurriculars or go to bed early if i am tired weekends when i can watch movies at night or go somewhere fun in the day museums nature centers bookstores etc this is not all ed related a lot of this is just managing life and depression as well but considering that i have had an ed for six years it is not an easy thing to make sure i eat enough every day  i do so but it takes more energy than the average person poor sleep affects me more easily as does bad weather especially the rain the whole notion of wanting to regress to a child kind of applies to me especially since i have not really had many good memories since 8th grade life has been hard crying writing this,1,386
purged again after five months i am so fucking tired i have been binge free since the start of november purge free since late november i believe around that time my eating disorder developed to just restriction heavy restriction at that that went on for all of december and then i fainted and decided i must stop restricting so much so i upped my intake every week and then for the past six weeks i have been at maintenance and i have felt good and comfortable i am slowly getting myself used to not being completely in control eating meals my parents made having sweet treats every day etc it is been going very well today was my cousins birthday and we went over to celebrate and have cake with them my impulse was to skip lunch before but i said fuck that and had a good nutritious and very filling lunch and i did not feel guilty then we went over to my aunts place greeted them my cousin got to open his presents all that and then it was time for the cake my aunt had made this huge chocolate and strawberry cake i had a piece and it was so good i ate pretty slowly because i was still full from lunch but i did not feel guilty it was amazing and then everyone was having seconds or thirds and i decided to have a second piece too both to challenge myself and because it would be reasonable with a cake that good and i wanted some more like a normal person would i got a small one because i was very full and started eating it and the second i started chewing the guilt hit me like a fucking train it was like i was right back at my worst restriction in december i could not just stop eating though because there was only a small piece left and my mom knows about my issues and she sat next to me so i ate it and i tried to feel good about it i told myself i deserved this and that it is part of recovery all that but it was fucking impossible and i felt so disgusting and my stomach was so full and it all got too much i excused myself to the bathroom and i purged like 20 times for the first time in five months first time since i started to recover then i just sat on the toilet and felt so empty because while the purging did ease the guilt from eating but it was just replaced with the realisation i broke my streak and of how huge of a setback this is i considered myself recovered from purging and in the moment when i got the second piece of cake i was feeling so confident that i would just eat it and feel fine now i do not know where i am i trusted myself that i would not do it but i did and i feel so fucking useless i really do not know what to do anymore,1,519
body fighting to keep me healthy does anyone else feel like they try and restrict and their body just fights back like no matter how much of a deficit i am in my body will want to get me back to maintenance its not fair i used to be good at restricting and now all i am good for is binging and gaining weight someone please help i am literally obese now,1,72
hair loss making me feel suicidal trigger warning for suicidal thoughts i feel like such a loser for having to turn to reddit for everything i go through especially for something like this but i do not have anybody else to turn to no therapist no friends and i do not feel comfortable enough to tell anybody about these things sometimes i just need to write out my feelings i am quite literally balding every time i tug on my hair it comes out my hair has never felt so thin and i have never felt so ugly i have been seeing people say that it takes months to grow back your hair after recovery which leaves me hopeless i was already struggling with suicidal thoughts before but not as bad as this i feel like i am ready to give up on life and that i will never be beautiful or happy another thing does anyone else heavily restrict not just for weight loss but because you hope that it will kill you the only thing stopping me from fully committing to it is my sister every day i rot in bed so that i do not have to face myself in the mirror i sit there thinking about how freeing it would be if i could just have a heart attack right now i have no resources and no help and i cannot get myself out of this cycle i swear my hair looks like i have cancer or something it is so bad every time i try to see pictures of other people suffering from anorexic hair loss they are not as bad as mine i feel so incredibly insecure and the stress is probably making it worse i do not know maybe some comforting advice might help me feel better i just have to get this out of my system,1,314
i dreamt listening to music had calories i was so broken hearted by realising that 1 i could obviously never listen to music again and 2 that i had listened to music all this time not knowing it would make me gain weight now that i am awake i am just wondering how far gone i am,1,57
does anyone else feel stuck this disorder feels like the only thing keeping me sane i will have a panic attack about things going on in my life and i just plan what i will eat tomorrow that is not normal but thinking about what food i will have tomorrow or the variables that might disrupt that stop my actual anxieties from getting worse i have not had any 988 episodes in awhile,1,73
just relapsed 4 years later maybe this is a good time to talk about my history laughing out loud i 21f have struggled with ana amp b p though only at the beginning since late 2019 but it is been on and off the worst was during 2020 and i thought i was almost better since i have not been as active in my ed tendencies thoughts etc for the past few years but it suddenly came back at the end of 2023 and now i am at my worst point i have ever been in my ed and my lowest weight ever i think it is important to note that i like the way i look like this which is horrible because i look extremely sick without posting numbers i am also technically considered underweight according to bmi and other calculations like that now we get to my parents i came home from college recently and i am at my lowest weight and my parents would not stop commenting on my weight and body saying i am way too skinny it does not look good i need to fatten up blah blah blah also my mom said that i am skinny like i was before ya because my ed came back and is twice as worse now so she notices it makes me question if she has a feeling there is a problem or something but i doubt she will say something because another quote by my mom engrained in my mind is wear clothes that cover your body so people cannot see because you do not want them thinking you have some sort of mental issue no one knows about my ed or at least i have never told anyone they might be able to tell so many people in my life mostly adults keep pointing out how skinny i am etc and that i need to eat they also ask if i am trying to lose weight i do not know what to say because yes i am but obviously i cannot say that i do not know what to do because i do not want to recover but my parents will be incessant i like how i look and i do not want to go back to my normal weight which is literally considered skinny to most but i think this is causing health issues and or exacerbating them and that scares me i suppose this is just a rant i do not know what advice i even want or need but if anyone has any it would be appreciated,1,434
kraft mac n cheese why has this become a new safe food does anyone else eat this for a safe food or is it just me the guilt consumes heh,1,30
flip flopping i decided to try to try and recover but it is causing me lots of stress despite the fact i have only increased my intake by gt 100 calories lt half the time i feel like i want to recover and excited at the fact that i can eat things i have not allowed myself in ages but this also makes me feel like an imposter and that i never had a problem with restriction in the first place the other half of the time i feel guilty for eating as much as i have i also still get pangs of fear at the idea of eating more than one meal a day and i am just finding it so frustrating that i keep switching between these two i hate myself right now and wish i did not feel broken in this way,1,145
so done with this shit literally just the title hope this post does not get taken down too for being pro ed lt 3,1,24
feels like i am going backwards i am about to be 2 years into anorexia recovery and i was doing great for a while eating fear foods not feeling guilty really just enjoying myself then the last 6 months or so i have felt myself fear eating something then think no that is just the ed brain i deserve to enjoy this food then i immediately feel guilty afterward as much as i tried to work on my relationship with exercise i still compulsively exercise 2 3 times a day and feel very anxious when i do not have the opportunity to exercise every day like when i have family plans or a busy day at work that occupies all of my time i start berating myself for not getting a workout in i also have ocd so i feel like that has a lot to do with it as my eating disorder was very centered around numbers basically i am just asking if anyone has any advice on how to stop thinking this way i know my brain is probably plagued with this thinking for the rest of my life but i am so tired of not being able to quiet these thoughts i constantly feel like i am taking one step forward but then two steps backward,1,219
i have 15 cavities today i went for my yearly cleaning at the dentist they told me i have 15 cavities receding gums and severe gingivitis i never smoked vaped or did drugs in my life i have my fair share of sugary drinks and food and forget to brush sometimes but it is pretty severe so it was most likely caused from purging i am only 16 i thought i was somehow immune to this and it would not catch up to me but it did please try to stop purging,1,92
just a reminder that if you interact in anyway with edtiktok it will keep showing up i am a frequent visitor to edtt i keep it entirely separate from my main tiktok and the amount of people i see commenting for example on a very low cal wieiad saying why would you post this it is so triggering i am trying to recover and i keep seeing low calorie recipes this is your psa doing anything but clicking not interested is going to being more of that to your fyp if you comment save like the video at all even if the comment is i do not like this content it is going to keep showing up i have a tiktok that is not ed related at all and in the 4 years i have used it i have only gotten 6 or 7 ed weightloss videos i immediately ignore them sorry for the rant but for goodness sakes please figure out what an algorithm is and stop commenting on these videos,1,172
i hate this shit tw throwing up i just want to look how i want to look i starve nyself and i get close to where i want to be then i binge and gain it back i was at my sweet spot last year and i fucking ruined it by eating i try not to but i get cravings and its fucking bad now i am here making myself throw up over and over even though i am just going to fucking binge again its embarassing my family thinks i have bad stomach issue cuz of how much i make myself throw up but they do not know the truth i feel like shit i am tired of hating how i look and tired of food,1,127

vent post being in china for vacay is so crazy triggering tw mentions of weight god these have got to be some of the worst two weeks of my life i am so so so miserable every single day i have always struggled with an ed which has gotten better and worse over the course of what honestly feels like my entire life every single moment i am here i am surrounded by the skinniest stick thin chinese women who all look so effortlessly gorgeous all the time it is so hard to not feel like pure crap about myself around them 24 7 it does not help that all my aunties and relatives do is talk about losing weight staying thin comparing themselves to each other etc all i want to do is restrict restrict restrict but it is nearly impossible when all the food here is drowning in fats oils sugars etc and my relatives are constantly pushing me to eat more and culturally it is so rude if i refuse these are some real things that people have said to me i have overheard that have triggered tf out of me and i cannot handle anymore i hate feeling this way and struggling with this disorder and being here is making it virtually impossible to recover the only thing it is doing is constantly digging me deeper when shopping together my mom said she would buy me a dress as long as i did not gain any weight she is clearly disordered too laugh my ass off and probably projecting because the saleslady also said some things about her weight aunties asking me how much i weigh guessing what i weigh so far off i freaking wish and then telling me how much she weighs so much lighter than me great aunt was treating us to some pastries and while looking my mom told me to put things down and not get things because they are too big the one time i actually i wanted to eat my mom in general telling me to slow down do not eat that that is so unhealthy etc my grandpa saying that i grew fatter gained weight as soon as he saw me i last saw him early january adults constantly constantly commenting on my body and figure this coupled with the fact that there is a scale in every single hotel room here is making it so genuinely impossible for me to enjoy this trip i do not even want to take a single picture of myself and i end up snapping at my mom every time she points her camera at me i feel so fat and disgusting and i want to cry every time i look in the mirror i hate how all my clothes fit me and i just want to go back to my old skinny self from october before i fell into a depression and binge ate all the time and did not leave my bed this is honestly only the tip of the iceberg and i cannot truly articulate how i feel right now because i am so upset writing it all out has made me feel a bit better though and i know this community is here for me this is my first edit second post on here lol thank you if you read all the way through and i hope everybody has a good day,1,574
what now long post ahead as i am typing this i am only realizing the real depth of my eating disorder i am honestly not sure as to when it all began but its most obvious manifestation started about a year ago when i cut contact with someone i really liked lol emphasis on past tense when i started leaning out by watching what i eat working out consistently for a while it was amazing i was losing weight fast i actually felt a sense of control over my life amp i felt like i could do anything i liked how i looked i felt strong amp i was eating food that made me feel good this was perhaps the best time of my life considering i used to be bullied in middle school for my weight amp basically not falling into the stereotypical beauty standards i i usually weighed myself everyday or if i forget at least 3x a week at the time i had predicted that i would reach my goal weight by that day s weigh in amp to my surprise i had gone below my goal weight by losing an additional 2 lbs of course i was ecstatic but it did not stop there i soon grew obsessed over how fast i was dropping weight so i started eating less amp basically doubling my physical regimen at my lowest weight however i felt scared amp realized this was not the way to live with the constant avoidance of food social gatherings where i had to eat etc i was always feverish i tried recovering but note that all efforts were by myself never sought medical help slowly i tried eating more amp i was at a sort of goldilocks zone still underweight as i had wanted but not as bad as before but that is when the cravings began as freshman year started i began binging more amp more as pressure amp demands piled amp at my lowest amp heaviest i had gained x kg prior the start of classes i feel so terrible for being such a vain bitch but that is how i knew i had a problem i literally could not function as a person knowing i did not look my best thinking fuck it is all like middle school all over again no one can tell me otherwise pretty privilege is a thing while i would never ever act with contempt towards anyone the general public does not perceive as attractive i e not falling within their standards of beauty i know what it feels like to be on the receiving end of that amp i would rather ctrl x myself than go back to that i am too ashamed to say it out loud especially to anyone i know that this has been what is been eating me from the inside along with the shit tonne of laxatives i take on a triweekly basis xoxo not being able to perform to the best of my academic abilities because i am too hellbent on seeing the scale drop so much that i feel my feet chained on top of it when i could be on my desk amp paying that kind of heed to my books amp schoolwork i have never told anyone who knows me but it is gotten so bad to the point that may have formed schizoidal tendencies just to deal with the fear of being perceived i have been on the verge of flunking the first semester all because of the emotional repercussions not to mention the total alienation i feel what did i expect i literally skip eating lunch with anyone amp everyone lol recently this year i reached my original weight prior the start of classes but at this point i am so spent hence i binged again an increase of x kg there is a tiny voice inside me saying it is fine i am still underweight but it is the feeling of binging that i hate the most the feeling of not being able to move your skin feeling so tight you could burst the feel of otherwise loose clothing over my distended belly the unnecessary sweating the flatulence god when will it end i figured it was time i ditched the scale amp actually start eating to fuel myself that i start working out to combat my depression diagnosed finally that i stop caring so much what people think but i realized it is still all me beautiful or not i have never really been good at dealing with people nor could i keep them for long so i figured i might as well be untouchable rather than repulsive i could not care less about what they think what matters to me is how i see myself and to me if i am not perfect what am i here i am again with another bulk order of laxatives that i would spent the last of my allowance on wondering when it will end itself for me because i know damn well i will not end it myself will not or cannot what difference does it make the only way out is through ps they should invent a way out that is not through what is my best course of action,1,887

people who have reached out to loved ones and received support how did you do it tldr people who have reached out to loved ones when actively suicidal and received support how did you go about it what did you ask for what information did you give what information did you leave out what did you say that got you listened to and the severity of your headspace understood what am i missing here i am trying to recover from a restrictive ed but i keep relapsing because i am not tackling the deeper issue mental health i have been going downhill since december i have good psychotherapy in place to start mid may but i am genuinely scared that i will not make it until then i have been trying to reach out to a small selection of loved ones for a couple of months and it feels like nobody is reaching back i cannot end my life i have a 4yr old daughter and she loves me more than anything else in the world ending my life is ending hers and i could never do that to her hence the desperate showing of vulnerability and reaching out i do not want emotional support from loved ones i just want company to ride it through and bring me back into the real world spend the afternoon at the beach with me come run boring errands with me try a new bakery with me let me spend the afternoon in your company while i do some uni work and we do not say a word idc i have reached out to multiple loved ones purposely i figured that asking multiple people less unhealthy reliance one 1 person bringing them down i have specifically asked for things like this i have not told them why but i have mentioned that i am feeling a bit low and want to feel part of the world again i do not want to tell them outright that i am actively suicidal because i do not want people to spend time with me in fear that i will kms if they do not i want them to spend time with me because they like my company i have been persistent but nobody is reaching back and i feel so unloved even if that is not the case which is only making it worse i know people have lives but when so many people are consistently busy it hurts one person in particular i felt so close to has slowly been decreasing the amount of time spent with me and leaving me on seen for days without a simple had a busy day will reply when they used to be consistent with that kind of thing i have asked to talk about it either a quick in person chat or a phone call and they do not even bother finding 30m of their time for either i just want to know why it feels like they are able to make time for everybody else except me if they do not want to spend time with me that is fine and i will move on but being left in limbo with all these questions is hurting so much so i guess that is another thing just adding to it all i feel like i have condensed a lot of complicated things into one vague post but i know the post will end up even longer if i do not haha,1,583
someone tell what is this hii first off all i do not know if this could belong here if it does not please someone let me know i will delete it i have been struggling with ed and sh for a while and went into recovery since jan and have been doing kind of okay but nowhere i feel like i might relapse and i feel like i do not deserve to be in recovery and i should just treat myself like shit and keep doing what i was doing   it kept me busy pretty and in control i have been doing kind of okay but i have been changing hair color cutting it basically feeling like that is the only thing i have under control now it is weird for me to be in recovery and it feels like i should not recover,1,144
i do not understand people little rant about this one friend she knows i 17f struggle with an ed she is privileged enough to be able to get good private doctors she knows i am not yet she keeps talking to me about how little she is eating how she only ate x y and z bcs of her stomach problems sending me snap videos of her taking her medication she was prescribed and saying she is not going to take it anymore or she is going to take more than the doctor told her i guess i am just jealous and angry that she was able to get professional help even if its not ed related and i was not and she is taking it for granted she also keeps bragging about how little she is eating recently when i met up with her she said something along the lines of oopsies i did not eat all day today but previously in the day she sent me snaps of her eating a meal i know her very very well and she does not have an ed obviously i cannot be 100 percent certain but i know her enough and she is always saying stuff like my stomach hurts it could be cancer or an eating disorder uwu and laughs it just kind of feels invalidating as if she is making it into something stupid something comedic as if this illness did not strip me from my teenage years i have been blunt with her and told her that she is triggering me and all she replied with was oh thought she would stop but she did not sorry if this sounds stupid but i am just so tired of people turning eds into something goofy and silly something that you can switch off after you had your little attention seeking moment,1,312
i cannot stand looking like this tw body issues i hate my body so much i hate hiw my body is built i hate where fat gets stored and i hate that i look like this when the standard for guys is skinny i am tall but my body looks so weird i hate it i stopped eating completely till i get back down to where i want to be atleast i can burn fat off my body but i am probably going to end up binging as soon as i get to where i want to be i hate being built like this but i am to depressed and unmotivated to do anything about it in a healthy way i have accepted i am never going to look like my friend who i wanted to look like body wise but i want to be happy in my own skin for once,1,152
my new antipsychotic makes me ravenously hungry and i am struggling to take it because of that advice needed i am not sure if the trigger warning flair is needed but i put it because the post discusses medication on top of that it gives me slight akathisia but its not as bad as other meds i tried in the past i have been through so fucking many medications in the last two years that all have not worked or had side effects this one is somewhat working and the side effects are ignorable enough i know i should take it and i know the hunger could get better once i get used to the med but holy shit its bad i feel like i have a black hole in my stomach if i do not binge i still overeat or i restrict and have to deal with this extreme hunger it does not help that i crashed from a manic episode in which i lost a lot of weight because i had no appetite and barely a desire to eat amongst other reasons and that affects my hunger cues too i am trying to be okay with it i am trying not to compensate for the binges because i know it makes them worse i am not in recovery but i am trying to harm reduce because i am dealing with a lot of other health issues both mental and phsyical and i am barely functioning if anyone has any tips on how to get myself to take them regularly please tell me i need help,1,267
i did something awesome my new friend and i were leaving the bar and had been talking about this place with good milkshakes that stays open late he suggested we go right then spontaneously and i agreed without even thinking a disordered thought normally stuff like that would send me spiraling but i enjoyed what i wanted and have some yummy milkshake leftover for whenever i feel like it i think i am starting to find my groove,1,78

i am barely 21 and i am going to die of heart failure soon i have only really had disordered eating on and off for less than two years and have a normal bmi and yet i will be extremely lucky to live for even five more years i felt 100 fine until well after id irreparably damaged my heart get help now to anyone who is thinking of recovering and is looking for a sign this is your sign my recent echocardiogram shows moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction but my doc said he is 75 confident that the fancier more complicated echo i am getting sometime in the next couple days is probably going to show that i do in fact have left ventricular heart failure there is a super small chance it might have been caused by a chronic malformation of some kind that they missed the first time but that is extraordinarily unlikely due to the fact that a left ventricular malformation bad enough to because these issues now would have probably killed me as an infant there is functionally zero doubt that disordered eating fucked up my body so badly in only 22 months that it will take a miracle for me to make it through five years without dying of heart failure i know that disordered eating helps you cope with things i know that it helps you feel in control of things i know that it is likely become so intertwined with your sense of self that you do not know where you end and it begins i know that the idea of talking to your parents or whoever else about it seems impossible i know that recovery is scary but trust me when i say that if i could go through every last one of those struggles trillions of times over right now in order to not die in my early twenties i would make that choice fucking instantly if you are like i was two years ago and your mental health is in a bad enough state that dying early seems preferable to you trust me when i say that you absolutely do not want to let your ed damage your health like this i am fucking miserable i am weaker and more exhausted by everything than my 80 year old grandmother my chest has hurt 100 of the time for the past 6 months straight everything takes for ever to understand it is like brain fog except that instead of my mental capabilities being dulled by malnutrition dissociation from body dysmorphia and or other mental health issues my brain has gotten so badly fucked by my cardiac issues that it is ridiculously worse at literally fucking everything everything is 10x harder to understand and it is never going to get better not even if i get a heart transplant or they somehow figure out how to cure lvhf or som shit like that this is from physical damage to my brain that shit does not go away you know how restriction can make you really dizzy take that and multiply it by a thousand i am a l with a y s dizzy any movement more than like slightly adjusting my sitting position can make it so bad i feel like i will pass out all the time every single thing that i do feels like running a marathon if i am eating anything that is substantial enough to take even five seconds to take chew and swallow a small bite i have to catch my breath and take a two or three minute break afterwards in order to build back up enough energy to take another one this shit sucks you do not want it recovery is not something you can put off take it from me you do not have to delay it for very long at all before it is too late treat disordered eating like you would cancer both of them can become terminal terrifyingly quickly if you decide to wait for it to get bad enough disordered eating of any kind is bad enough tl dr eating disorders can and will kill you ridiculously fast they are urgent medical problems and you need to try as hard as you can to get into recovery as soon as you can possibly manage i did not and because of that i am going to die in the short future please do not make the same mistakes i did edit here is a list of some of the worst shit i did to my heart there is a lot more than just those but those were the big ones in my specific case also edit this obvi are not a fun subject for me to talk about laughing out loud so i am hardly going to be active at all on this poat to answer questions or whatever c i hope what all i put already helps well enough also also edit i straight up stole the if you are looking for a sign thing at the start oops also also also edit i really appreciate the gold and all but i am going to more or less abandon this account pretty soon to replace it with one that is better for recovery shit so please do not spend it on this post it is just giving reddit money and reddit sucks,1,905
so i have seen a lot of people without eds hanging around this sub lately so here is a reminder for you lot run run as far and as fast as you can from here run from these mindsets and from this little collection of our communal suffering the memes are funny and the people are very welcoming and kind but we are dying these are façades to mask the suffering and the pain we are killing ourselves slowly we are rotting from the inside out there is nothing good here there is nothing healthy here there is nothing worthwhile here on these subs if you think you or someone you know is sinking into these thoughts get help do not feed the thoughts do not let the people you know feed the thoughts they are rabid dogs that will tear you apart mentally and physically we are nice we are funny but we are dying and we are lying save yourselves from this,1,164
my gf just died from an eating disorder i am devistated my gf was diagnosed with anorexia binge purging subtype we met after her last time in treatment she seemed to do okay for a while i did not notice any issues but i was not too familiar with the signs and symptoms of her disease now that i have read up more thoroughly all of the signs were there she was not losing that much weight she had always been thin and was recently looking much thinner but not scarily so a lot of weird things were happening though she would have nights where she would send me these illegible very off texts i figured it was because she was drinking but now i know it has to do with periods of confusion brought on by malnutrition and heart issues i think now i can remember her cheeks being swollen she had dry skin and was always cold she would just not remember things that we talked about recently anyway i had gone over to her house randomly last wednesday and her roommate let me in i walked into her room like covered in food and trash literally shit everywhere i knew immediately something was not right i comforted her threw out all the trash and talked to her about treatment she agreed and i called her mom who got the process started they said it would be like 4 weeks till their was room but she was going to call on monday to see if she could get in sooner i did not hear from her all day saturday she was going through a lot and thought she needed space she also had a habit of sleeping during the day for like 10 hours at a time when she was not working her mom had not called me or her roommates so i did not really worry i had told her everything was going to be fine i was just proud of her for agreeing to go to treatment i did not hear from her on sunday either i texted her a bunch and also called her parents i gave them her roommates number to check in on her even at that point i was just worrying about her mental health i did not think she was at risk for dying or anything on monday her roommate called me and told me the news they found her dead i am guessing it was due to heart issues from all the purging and restricting i do not know i am just devastated and do not know who to talk to about it despite this disease she was a truly amazing person she was honest and kind and genuine and all we ever did together was laugh she was only 24 i did not know this disease could strike so suddenly i feel so guilty i wish i would have read up more about her disease and acted sooner i just want to crawl into bed and die,1,508
does anyone have really absurd thoughts like for example i am planning on redecorating my apartment but i am like no i cannot do that yet because i have to wear a crop top and tiny yoga shorts and be skinny and play music and just generally feel like i am in a movie whilst being viewed throught the male gaze ahaha,1,62
within 10 minutes of the dentist checking my teeth she asked the assistant to leave the room then ask if i was suffering from an eating disorder she was actually really nice about it and said she was not going to lecture me and just wanted to know if i was getting help and if i needed any guidance on available help i said i was currently in recovery and only purge once the last month and she was really glad i could cry she was so sweet and understanding she said the erosion right now to is only to the back of my front teeth and is minimal and as long as i am in treatment and getting better it will be fine she gave me a whole thing with a checklist with harm reduction techniques and did a free fluoride treatment to help strengthen my teeth i am sure everyone here has heard all the tips a hundred times so i hope you all find a dentist as understanding and helpful,1,173

i just found out my friend uses me as reverse thinspo my life is falling apart right now a lot of bad things just happened to me recently on top of catching covid lmao and then i stumbled onto a friends anonymous pro ana twitter where there are pics of me me on my birthday at anime cons at the pool and the beach being lauded by her followers as reverse thinspo i know it is her because she has faceless bodycheck pics on there and i would recogn ize her tattoos room setup anywhere i know this disorder affects us deeply and i know we get intrusive thoughts that we cannot help but this is just so insidious and awful i just ican t imagine or fathom why she would do this why anyone would do that to someone else i am so brokenhearted that i am just another part of the competition to be seen as the skinniest and i have been thrown under the bus for not being small enough all by someone who i expected to understand what that feels like i do not know what to do and i feel like this destroyed any appetite i had built trying to recover and eat normally i do not even know how to address this with her it is giving me palpitations just thinking about how to bring this up update so i confronted her with a hey i need to talk to you about something serious and after she responded of course i sent her the screenshots and told her that i knew it was her pointed out her room furniture clothes her tats how her mirror was even the same mirror she uses in her insta photos etc i told her how deeply this hurt me and how despite all we have gone through together she decided to use me as a prop but after leaving me on read for an hour she started claiming that the account was not her and that she is hurt i would ever accuse her of such a thing and then suddenly the account went private this might have happened after i sent the messages but it was public right before i texted her because i went to check if twitter had done anything to the posts the profile picture was also suddenly changed too she is claiming that i am gaslighting her to make her feel guilty because i am upset over my recent weight gain i have not gained any weight at all recently i have only lost basically she is managed to turn this around on me and said she was afraid this would happen because everyone leaves her eventually i cannot believe the level of gaslighting right now she has not responded to my response yet and now i am just empty i prepared for a hundred responses but not denial and accusations like that update 2 thank you everyone for all your kind words of support this was really hard to deal with today and i really needed it this subreddit is so kind and helpful i have blocked her and another friend of mine amp i are cutting her out of our lives it is created a small divide but i am glad one of my friends is on my side afaik it looks like her twitter has been deleted or suspended too,1,570
as someone who has been underweight normal weight and overweight skinny shaming is not the same as fat shaming and i am tired of naturally skinny people acting like it is before you come at me with the curvy is the new beauty standard i can assure you that it is not social media is not real life skinny is the beauty standard and always will be if you ask literally anyone whether they would rather be skinny or fat they will say that they would rather be skinny 100 of the time fat will always be used as an insult no one will ever say you look fat as a compliment nobody ever develops bed as a result of being skinny shamed but thousands of people have developed anorexia and or bulimia at least partially as a result of being fat shamed look jessica i am sorry that your crush called you a twig in 6th grade but it is not comparable to being treated like a subhuman you have never had to settle for being the fat funny friend and it fucking shows,1,185

you either die an anorexic or live long enough to develop three other eating disorders while simultaneously romanticizing the fuck out of your time spent as an anorexic even though in reality you were weak cold and balding,1,38
the every body is beautiful movement is basically saying that no matter your size you as a woman can be a desirable sex object i grew up with those dove ads with the growing discourse of you do not need to be thin to be beautiful while i agree with that i think focusing on beauty still sends the wrong message seeing those ads as a kid did not make me feel good about myself they made me feel pressured to be beautiful in an i am an object way the fact that every woman is beautiful is a more popular discourse than ever woman is capable eg smart powerful not limited due to being female is legit troubling to me it is basically just western capitalism saying that all women are worthy of being objectified edit typo,1,138
why food have calory i hate it here,1,8
i hate this subreddit i just posted in this subreddit about how i had a really positive day in recovery today and two of you were kind enough to tell me to be careful and not swing into bed you do not know me you do not know my height my weight my thoughts my body fat percentage the fact that i have been sick for over ten fucking years but you went out of your way to comment on my post and tell me not to develop bed in recovery that says a lot more about you than it does about me truly some of you really need to check yourselves do not come here to push your disordered fears of recovery onto someone who is actually recovering i get it this is a safe space for everyone with an eating disorder but for fuck s sake if you are in a bad headspace or feeling snarky then leave those yellow flaired posts alone ffs anyway some of you fucking suck as people and i am really disappointed,1,179

if you make a social media post about ed awareness and post a photo of your underweight body to show just how skinni you were your mom s a hoe full offense this shit makes me so mad like first of all if you do this you are reinforcing the harmful idea that the severity validation of an ed is directly correlated with how skinny you get which is bullshit and also makes me think you are not fully recovered if you have this mindset it does not matter if you use a tw people will still use it as thinspo thinspo is thinspo regardless of your intentions who is the photo helping who needs to see this skinny ed trauma porn not me bitch it is just so unnecessary and harmful and yet people still do it all the time like are you proana or are you just dumb i do not need to see a photo that goes along with your message about just how bad it got at your lowest point or your lowest weight because apparently you think these things are synonymous you can spread awareness about eds without spreading thinspo any anyone who defends their thinspo with i am just trying to spread awareness can suck my dick thanks for listening,1,216

this is not fucking mpa things i have seen in the last couple weeks people finding ways over and over again to bring up their very low weight bmi intake in almost false self deprecation when your mom says do not ruin your appetite and your bmi is 12 and you have not eaten in six days xd someone posting about restriction and saying they are excited to get skinny and hot and people in the comments saying they are proud someone saying they were chubby because their 23 bmi was almost overweight announced they were losing weight and planned to skip breakfast and lunch then was wished good luck in the comments literally what the fuck someone asking if they could recover at a very very low bmi because they did not want to gain and get fat in recovery several people in the comments said yes they could recover at an extremely unhealthy bmi people writing in depth about how skinny they want to be and discussing very underweight celebrities they want to look like violation of rule 2 a sprinkle subtle fat shaming i would not be surprised if they shut down the subreddit because to be honest if i was a moderator and saw some of the stuff people are posting here i would probably want to as well you can rant as much as you want but you cannot provide what is basically thinspo or enable other people in dangerous or disordered behavior,1,248
does it ever piss you off how easy it would be to eat a surplus of 3 500 calories and gain a pound in a day and how impossible it would be to do the opposite it makes me irrationally angry like holy shit just get me some ramen and vegan cheese and i can gain a pound in a day easily but to lose a pound in one day i would have to consume zero calories and also somehow burn an extra 1700 calories on no energy one is like falling the other is like climbing,1,97
you almondmilkicedlatte passed away a few days ago i know she was active on here a lot and i do not know if it is weird for me to announce it but i think i am the only one in real life who knew her reddit also she had terminal cancer and did not die of anorexia just fyi but i know she really let go of her ed in the last few weeks and seemed to be having a good time enjoying food and everything i met her in recovery forums many years ago and she has always been so supportive of me and everyone even whilst literally dying she was there for me during my recent hospitalisation in a way no one else could be and i will endlessly appreciate that yeah i am not sure what to say but she was such a good person and i will miss her a lot,1,155

psa do not take your clothes off for your guidance counselor tw predatory behavior when i was in high school i was suffering with anorexia i was reported to my school from a few teachers and students i was sent down to the guidance office to have a talk well the guidance counselor was a male he did not believe that i had a disorder unless i took my clothes off my advisor was also in the room and she thought i should remove my clothes as well i always wore baggy clothes so no one could see my body he asked that is what anorexics do is not it we have to make sure you are not too underweight so take off your clothes the awful thing was i was going to i was ready to take off my clothes because i was so scared my parents were out of town and they threatened to send me in a mental hospital the guidance counselor and advisor said they had a police officer ready to take me the mental hospital i was terrified i was about to take my clothes off and they were so excited for me to do so but my saving grace walked through the door my school nurse was called in for my little meeting but they forgot about that she screamed at them for telling me to take my clothes off she stopped me from doing it i felt so disgusted with myself that i was about to do that i feel disgusted now that they are still working at my high school after i graduated i wish i said something i wish i was not such a coward do not let people get away witch treating you like crap if you have a disorder you are not a freak at a freak show you are not an experiment do not let people abuse you speak up and say no,1,325
i am sorry but demi lovato is making us ed bitches look bad lmaoo look i was happy to have someone as famous as demi be open about her eating disorder and bring some light into it but damn that froyo deal was a whole mess also that video she posted trying to clear things up gave me such haes vibes i was cringing so hard like babe there are people whose lives depend on not having sugar diabetics for example also others who want to lose weight healthily and some ed people who just want fro yo without sugar too like please let us not cancel sugar free lmao also i totally felt when she talked about how triggered she felt that was super realistic and a real struggle in recovery i just wish instead of going after a small business she would have hopped on ig and shared some of the struggles of recovery i do not know i felt like she was making us ed bitches look oversensitive and blaming our illnesses on diet culture yes diet culture sucks but it is not the reason why we are sick and it going away is definitely not going to make our lives easier,1,205
does anyone else feel like there is a certain casualness about being skinny to be honest that is like my main motivation when you are skinny you can wear whatever you want and head out the door you do not have to worry about whether or not your belly is hidden or if those pants make your thighs look big or if a top is going to show your big arms you can just be effortless and you would look amazing you could totally be forgiven for messy hair or shitty skin if you are skinny you can move around a lot be casual and effortless whatver the situation is,1,110

nothing tastes good as skinny feels more like nothing tastes as good as looking at pictures of the popular skinny girls from your middle high school and noticing you are now skinnier than them but also realizing that this competition to be the skinniest is literally only meaningful to you and anyway you have not seen these girls in years and it is not like they ever bullied you for your size or anything so this feeling of triumph really only shows how fucked up your mind is that you ascribe value to the size of a woman s body which is the very thing that you should be against because it is what led to your eating disorder amirite ladies      11,1,122
back when we called it pro anorexia everyone was better off hear me out today we have everyone and their dog guzzling down detox teas as fast as they can and calling it self care people are going without food for days on end and calling it a healthy lifestyle just take a glance at what is trending on instagram and i am sure you will find some sort of glorification of orthorexia within five minutes obviously underweight people are running recipe blogs and encourage others to follow along with their wellness journey while they drop pound after pound teenagers are chugging vinegar to curb their appetite tiktok is chock full of diet tips that could have come straight from a circa 2005 forum post written by tinythinbutterflygirl94 before pro ana was more or less banned from the internet people like this knew they were disordered and healthy outsiders knew not to take their advice because they knew they were disordered as well nobody went around praising anorexia as a healthy lifestyle it was widely recognized as a choice to live to an unhealthy one now these behaviors are socially acceptable and considered normal and healthy by your average person while obviously not everyone who partakes in these behaviors is disordered these tips n tricks are definitely less than healthy and were not mainstream before this shift when these unhealthy behaviors had the bite of being labeled pro ana attached to them they were much much less dangerous to your average viewer when we said that it would be incredibly damaging to force pro ana folks to go incognito they said it was just our disordered delusions and we were trying to manipulate people they said they knew best about the kind of life that some of us have been living for longer than these websites have been around and now society is paying the price,1,316
this is not a recovery based trigger free safe space of a sub i am going to ruffle some feathers with this but i have seen a lot of posts lately where people are upset with certain dialogue on this sub people saying please do not talk about or describe food because it triggers me   i am not comfortable eating like some of the people trying to recover or who have safe foods please stop talking about how little you eat it is elitist and makes other people with binge related eating disorders feel invalid please do not talk about how your so cold or dizzy or how all your clothes hang off you and how people are voicing concerns that you are underweight it comea off as bragging about how bad your ed is please do not talk about x symptom because it makes people who do not have it feel like failures inadequate please do not talk about x negative thoughts because it is triggering and hurts my recovery efforts please do not talk about how you do not like your body it makes people feel bad about theirs too this sub is not a recovery based sub its a place for people to vent about issues their ed causes in their life its a place to let out the thoughts their ed drills into them day in day out it is a place to say i am so obsessed with food weight fear and it fucking sucks it is a place for people to voice their problems without judgement to people who understand how fucked up this disorder is its not pro ed but it is also not a safe space i see a lot of people complaining about other peoples disorder triggering theirs because its different that is not helpful and actually tells people you are not allowed to speak here suffer in silence that goes against everything i understand this space to be   a place for us all to get the ed thoughts out of our head and maybe get some solidarity if you are trying to recover remove this sub from your feed you do not have a right to tell others to stop triggering you on a sub that never promised to have no triggers you do not have the right to tell people to censor their disorder because it makes you uncomfortable you are responsible for your well being and your recovery not other eating disordered people if you see something truelly harmful alert the mods otherwise scroll by or block users who bother you or better yet unsub and focus your attention on the pro recovery subs out there no one is winning the eating disorder olympics just let people not be ok in peace,1,464
let us say it together me hating my body has nothing to do with how i view yours i was on tiktok and some girl made a tiktok about how the cottage cheese and mustard trend is so ed core and eating healthy is violence against fat people and i commented that i think it is unfair that people love to villianize other people for having an ed and hating their bodies when it is a mental illness like depression or anxiety and nobody with an ed really cares about how other people look and some girl commented that people with eds deserve to be villianized because they wish d ath upon fat people like her and i responded with you need to go outside and touch grass because as someone who is had an ed for 8 years been in various ed communities and support groups i have not heard anyone wish de th upon another person especially for being fat and miss girl deleted her comment i am not saying i ate but i hate these false allegations,1,180

when my boyfriend amp i signed up at l a fitness together the tactics they use to recruit women vs men where disgustingly apparent edit i am really bothered that i cannot fix the where to were we were both talking to a rep together when they were talking to me they bring out this chart of illustrated not real women with body fat percentages assigned to them from skinny to obese they pointed at a fat girl drawing and said i was here and asked me where i wanted to be and before i could even answer pointed to a ridiculously skinny illustration of a woman and said you want to be here as a rhetorical question when i pointed to an average size woman they said oh do not tell me you want to be there you are lying before talking about how i could achieve my desired fat percentage level when they spoke to my boyfriend it was not about fat loss at all they talked about muscle gain but there was no muscle density chart or fat loss chart they shoved in his face and pointed at something undesirable and told him that is what he is they did not tell him that his fitness goals were too modest for him to be telling the truth they did not talk about his current fitness level at all and did not mention fat loss once while talking to him fuck l a fitness they prey upon the insecurities of women they fuel a toxic mentality towards fitness for women making it all about fat loss instead of becoming healthy stronger gaining muscle training for something i will never support l a again and i am glad i quit that over priced mean girls club,1,297

my mom died from anorexia nervosa 3 weeks ago title says almost everything i need to say she started about three years ago and eventually used it as a vehicle to commit suicide in the last three months of her life she had so little muscle left that she could not walk or even get out of bed during the last month she could not lift her head or move her arms during the last few days she could no longer even drink water through a straw a nurse came every week to exchange her catheter and my dad changed her diaper as needed i am completely crushed and i just cannot make sense out of any of it i am pretty fucked up as a result of watching it happen and being powerless to stop it in anticipation of some questions i may be asked yes we did try to help her she had been through longer term hospitalizations twice and many shorter ones recovery never took the doctors said she did not meet the guidelines to be forcibly fed and or forcibly committed to a mental health facility we were only able to get her the treatment she consented to she became orthorexic three years ago this devolved into i hate eating i want to kill myself i wonder how long i can live if i just stop eating the because of death on her death certificate is anorexia nervosa she was an older person late 60s and i am an adult in my 30s i never knew her to be anorexic or display any anorexic tendencies during my entire life except during the last few years,1,279

science says overeating for one or two days does not make you gain real weight 3500 cals 1 pound of fat except eating more increases your rmr as the more you eat the more calories your body expends digesting food feel hot after a big meal your body does not know what to do with the extra food so it is being turned into heat your weight may jump but the most likely because will be water retention use christmas as an excuse to get the micronutrients in that you have been missing out on if you are restricting you cannot gain 5 pounds of fat in two days our bodies just do not work like that my dudes love you all drink some water have your fave snack even if it is a safe food challenge yourself if you feel up to it do not challenge yourself if it is too much this year do what you got to do to have a good holiday just wanted to let you all know they science says that you can indulge today and be fine,1,184

body positive models make me feel 500 worse i hate the body positive movement it is made me feel even worse about my body and my existence these body positive models usually are about 5 15 pounds overweight at most and still have a perfect waist to hip ratio and not to mention a beautiful face although they may face oppression and discrimination in the modeling industry they would be worshipped in normal society it is like these models are only allowed one flaw if she has vitiligo she has to be beautiful and thin if she is fat she has to be beautiful and an hourglass if she has a large nose she has to have every other facial feature and her body make up for it it is even with actresses and other celebrities when people say jennifer lawrence and marylin monroe are body positive role models i get dysphoric as fuck because they are both way smaller and way more shapely than i could ever hope to be i heard someone on the view say kim kardashian was a hero for women with big butts and thighs i am sorry what i have a large ass and huge thighs and i have never felt empowered by a woman with a waist half the size of mine lastly it seems like the body positive movement is first and foremost becoming mainstream because they want to sell you something plus size clothes makeup to enhance rather than conceal your beauty the industry still preys on insecurities as much as it always have but is now peddling them as acceptance i think we should stop trying to expand the definition of beauty not everyone is beautiful and that is okay your worth is not determined by how physically attractive you are,1,301

shoutout to anorexics who began to lose weight when they were overweight obese and everybody praises their weight loss despite their mental illness everyone who suffers with disordered eating is valid and does not need to prove that their disorder is bad enough to be considered valid but shoutout to those people whose weight loss was praised and they were encouraged to keep losing which only lead to them becoming more and more disordered eating disorders are a mental problem they do not have a certain bmi or weight that you have to reach for your mental illness to become serious enough for treatment you are seen you are valid and you are supported in recovery,1,116
i am so glad you are recovering from your ed but there is literally no need to post evidence of how emaciated and sick you were before you can celebrate recovery without posting literal body checks on reddit for fuck s sake sincerely extremely triggered,1,45
good news guys i have decided that i no longer have an eating disorder i am undiagnosing myself i am normal now lt 3 sorry to all you sick dummies who cannot suddenly snap their fingers and have a healthy relationship with food and their bodies but i am different,1,50
death and recovery are not the only two possible outcomes to your eating disorder there i said it we have been told all our lives that the choices are either to recover or eventually die but for some of us there is this grey area that we are stuck in that does not end like that we are underweight yeah but barely and our bodies do not show dramatic signs of anything wrong happening we are never going to be sent to ip we do not pass out in the street or anywhere we eat just less than we should our lives are not hell on hearth and we manage to have a job and sometimes even serious relationships our ed is constantly in our minds but we manage to have hobbies and activities we enjoy and we will probably be like this forever this is reality for many many people who suffer from eating disorders and we are continuously ignored by media our family and even our therapist because we do not fit the pre conception they have and our bodies are not at an inmediate risk more should be done to get people like us to recover because it is still fucking annoying to live with this bullshit thanks for coming to my ted talk,1,217
i stopped a binge by giving all my food to a homeless woman and her kid yeah pretty much the title i went out to buy some binge food and got about 60 worth of it while walking home i saw a woman with her daughter hugging each other to stop shivering i was disgusted at myself for being such unappreciative person and gave all my food to them they were nervous at first but since they were mostly pre packaged things they accepted it i am glad that i got a little bit of self control and some other people are going to eat tonight as well it is a win win d p s i hope this does not sound mean or like a brag edit thank you guys for all the sweet comments i am in tears right now i am thinking about making such gesture a regular thing and spend my binge food money on necessities for homeless people since most charities are closed and i cannot volunteer in person but again thank you for all the kind words,1,183
trump might have just cured my ed i recently hired an ed recovery coach to try something new i have only been working with her for 3 weeks but today she hit me with a challenge no one through years of therapy and multiple times in treatment has ever tried she said every time i purge i have to donate 5 to the trump campaign in my name fuck she hit me where it hurts i am extremely attached to my finances and i fucking hate trump i think i am cured of my ed,1,95

when i was fat when i was fat a boy called me a beached whale in front of our sports class the teacher told him to settle down as i felt my cheeks burn when i was fat a friend jiggled my double chin and said if i just lost weight i could be pretty she told me my chubby cheeks made me look like a squirrel when i smiled it took me a long time to learn to love my smile again after that when i was fat my dad asked me where he went wrong as a parent how could my brother be so athletic while i ballooned each year in this household where carbs were practically a reincarnation of the devil himself when he found the empty ice cream containers and chocolate wrappers he told me i was disgusting he said he was embarrassed to tell people i was his daughter when i was fat i bought an expensive jumpsuit for a big upcoming party i spent hours perfecting my hair and makeup i squeezed into heels so that my legs could look long when i got there the boy i liked looked me up and down turned to his friend and loudly whispered fat b they laughed and left and i wished i could fall through the floor when i got home that night i cried because i was a shy nerdy girl and i could not imagine what i had done to make him say that i thought i used food to control my emotions but really i was controlled by food every night when my family had gone to sleep i would pull out thousands of calories from underneath my bed i would buy it after school from the grocery store a different one each time because i feared the cashiers would recognise me and see exactly where all this food went my cheeks my waist my thighs i would stuff my face until my stomach ached and the nausea crept up my throat and i was sure i had abused myself enough to truely be the beast people told me i was over the past year i have lost enough weight to now be on the low side of a healthy bmi i have basically switched to a restriction ed largely driven by the comments of people around me and today the boy who called me a fat b asked me out for dinner after over a year of not seeing each other he said i looked great and he wondered why we did not talk more in high school i wanted to break down and yell at him for ruining my self esteem i wanted him to know how many nights i had spent crying over his careless words but instead smiled and said i was happier leaving the past in the past i do not know why i wrote this i guess i am just frustrated with how the world works i wish i could have enjoyed high school i wish people could have seen more to me than just my weight i wish i did not think about food constantly oh well,1,532

i did some research on the bmis people with eds usually die at it made me really sad but i figured i would share that info here due to how hard it is to come by accurate numbers on i am hoping that by sharing it here i can minimize harm in some way i looked at any study i could find with numbers these are the bmis of people who died despite hospital treatment and everyone doing their best to save them so keep that in mind i am looking at the extreme limits of the human body here the bmis that were lowest at death on average were the restrictive subtype anorexics without any listed comorbid conditions also not including suicides most died somewhere in the 10s to 12s maintaining a bmi under 15 for an extended period of time seemed to increase risk of death a lot out of a study of 23 one anorexic made it to 9 1 this is the lowest bmi i have found in any study they died of cardiac arrest one died of broncho pneumonia at 16 8 in another study others who died at higher bmis died from gastrointestinal hemorrhage or septic shock assuming from laxative abuse seizures diabetes or pneumonia infections occasionally restrictive anorexics died from electrolyte imbalances at higher bmis as well the most common because of death for this group was cardiovascular cardiac arrest or organ failure next lowest on average were the binge purge subtypes and alcoholic anorexics of any subtype apparently alcoholism is very common along with eds and deaths from a combo of the two seem to happen often benzodiazepines were another commonly abused drug leading to a higher likelihood of death another study mentioned alcohol abuse as the biggest predictor of death especially when combined with an underweight bmi purging is also obviously terrible for you and causes heart issues and electrolyte imbalances that often lead to death there was a greater range here and those who died from something other than suicide died anywhere between a bmi of 10 to 19 7 a few were listed as having a normal appearance at death after previously having gotten down to a very low bmi though the specific bmis of these was not recorded the last part makes me possibly the saddest about half the deaths were from suicide and it was the largest single because of death this included bulimics anorexics of any subtype and ednos osfed suicides were relatively common among every group but it looked like those who binge and purge were at the greatest risk of suicide overall they died anywhere from the 12s to overweight so those are the statistics i have found obviously this is only including deaths and not even mentioning the painful side effects and health conditions resulting from eds that usually start at much higher bmis do not think your ed is any less serious just because of any of these numbers these are literally the ultimate extremes and i was intentionally filtering things to look for people who died at lower bmis the majority of ed deaths from all causes happened at higher bmis than the extremes i have listed this is easier said than done i know but if you do not want to die a painful death then do not drink or abuse drugs do not purge and do not get to an extremely low bmi keep your electrolytes in check most importantly get your mental health taken care of eds are extremely deadly devastating and horrible for both your mental and physical health deaths from them and the unhealthy behavior surrounding it can pretty much happen at any weight links 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13,1,632
men do not like skinny women is such a lie i am so sick of reddit threads being like oh men prefer curvy women men do not like stick figures real women have curves runway models are for women not for men do they realize that 1 rich handsome men always date models and 2 you can be both curvy and skinny the most popular women on p right now subreddits are all almost underweight with big hips and fake boobs being skinny does not mean you lose your curves especially if you are tall need bigger hips or naturally busty so yeah i am really tired of all these men trying to reassure women or shame them into not restricting because in the end they still put skinny curvy women on a pedestal and then say but these women have boobs so they are not skinny bitch yes they are and i am tryna look like them now can you let me become emily ratajkowski in peace please at this point when a man tells me not to lose weight it just feels like he knows he does not stand a chance with a skinnier woman,1,197
just saw a tik tok of a fitness guy saying that no one should be eating below 1000 calories a day even for weight loss and of course 75 of the comments were aha i only eat 500 ooops if i ate that much i would get so fat suddenly i am deaf uh i eat 350 a day and still feel like it is a lot but how do you eat so much i try to eat over 1000 but i just get so full is 450 a lot i get that a lot of these girls probably have eds and are seeking validation but i just hate these comments so much especially when they claim to have a totally normal relationship with food like no you are either starving yourself and depraving your body of nutrients way underestimating how much you are eating or straight up lying either way stfu,1,152

does anyone else get ridiculously embarrassed at the thought of people hearing your food packages anything signaling you eating some safe foods like rice cakes have such loud packaging that i know my housemates will hear me opening even if i am alone in my room i find myself eating things that are more fattening and guilt inducing if it means they have more discreet packages eating something shitty or being heard eating something not so shitty which one s worse who knows,1,83

anorexia mirabilis today i learnt about some of the history of eating disorders and not going to lie it is really interesting especially seeing as anorexia nervosa is mostly documented from the 20th century onwards anorexia mirabilis is from the middle ages and was basically where women and girls would starve themselves for god as a sign of divinity it was mostly catholics that did it but reading into some of the cases their behaviour mirrors the behaviour of many of us catherine of siena had it and she apparently learnt it from her sister so clearly it ran in families who used it to control her husband control seems to be a theme catherine herself died from it and it was recorded that if forced to eat she would purge columba of rieti is another example and she also died from it and she also engaged in self harm behaviours under the guise of religion during the victorian era there were fasting girls who were often teenagers who claimed they were miracles who didnf require nutrition one case was a twelve year old girl who stopped eating when she was ten she was taken under medical supervision to see if she was genuine where her parents then would not allow her to eat even though doctors said she was dying as they believed she was holy she did die and they were charged with manslaughter it seems many fasting girls would secretly eat whilst claiming they did not which mirrors the secret eating of many sufferers of eating disorders today with the shame so many of us feel around eating and the irrational need to hide it when we do eat some of the fasting girls would also have stigmata which is the christian word for wounds or scars in the same place jesus had crucifixion wounds which sounds to me like self harm a behaviour many people today with eating disorders have i just find it fascinating that for centuries it was not seen as a mental illness but as a sign of religious devotion and that by using religion sufferers had an excuse it shows that while people claim it is all about the media and it is a 21st century and a first world problems it clearly is not as there have been clear cases of eating disorders dating back centuries with self harm often being present at the same time while the reasons for the disorders and the way they present themselves may have changed eating disorders have clearly been a phenomenon for centuries and i find that fascinating ngl,1,435
does anyone else not like body positive content no idea if this is controversial here but i am afraid to tell people this in person because i know it could come off badly i do not like body positive content online and it does not help me at all i do not mean i am just again haes or promoting obesity i dislike videos and pictures talking about cute squishy tummies and how everyone is beautiful and we need to love our cellulite etc i find it patronizing and dumb i think we really need to shift away from obsessing over our bodies in relation to our beauty and worth to me making content solely about bodies and body positivity just reenforces this obsession over size and beauty standards i genuinely do not connect with any body positive content and it makes me feel empty inside a lot of content creators are perfectly sweet and well intentioned and all the comments will be like wow this helped me so much i finally feel confident and meanwhile i cannot even imagine an insta post or video having an impact on my brain s bizarre internalized obsession with size is this just me it is almost like body image issues are so complex and individual that body positive content just feels empty and superficial and does not actually do anything for me,1,230
i connected with another anorexic in the store so i went through the shelves and i saw this skinni girl who looked concentrated on the nutrition information of coconut milk i stood around 3 meters away and done the same thing because i need coconut milk too one short moment we looked each other in the eyes and than she said all of a sudden here that is the lowest cal version and showed me her coconut milk i was so perplex it took me a few seconds for a thanks and a smile hope she saw that i am smiling in my eyes this was such a wierd situation because i barely meet someone with an ed in real life but in this moment i felt so understanded did someone else have a funny or interesting meet an ed person in real life story,1,145

people do not like you because you are more confident they like you because you are thin i cannot stand on all the weight loss subreddits how every time someone mentions being treated better by people because they have lost weight there is inevitably 9000 comments talking about how it is not about the weight it is because you are taking care of yourself and acting more confident bullshit i have been up and down in weight many many times in my life with the same low bar of confidence every time people treated me better when i was thin because they liked the way i look i wish people would be more honest about this stuff i feel like it would in some ways be easier if everyone was just honest all the instagrammers posting about being healthy and doing it for their bodies and feeling good people talking about being concerned with other people s health and not the way they look etc i feel like there is a giant pink elephant in the room and everyone just pretends it does not exist and i feel crazy because it seems like i am the only one who can see the elephant let us be real people care about how you look they treat you better when you look better anyway that is my rant for today thanks,1,229

my dad always gets me a very specific order from starbucks and today they sent him home with a sweet message for context my dad gets me a grande cafe misto with almond milk and sf caramel 48 kcal and lovely pretty much every single day since it is like my one source of comfort during the day the local drive through sbs has gotten it wrong on occasion leading to a lot of tears etc a few months ago he explained to the woman whilst waiting that i had pretty severe an hence why he always had to double check that everything was perfect otherwise it could be majorly upsetting for me she sympathised and said she would watched her sister start to slip into a potential restrictive disorder but thankfully she has not spiraled too far anyway now a few of the baristas know my order off by heart and why it has to be so specific he was waiting today while they brewed the filter and the person at the window explained they actually only let those specific people make my drink who know how amp why because they do not want to upset me and want to make sure it is always correct he came home and had the above message written on my cup and it just really made my day it was really nice knowing how thoughtful they are and understanding sorry for the ramble i just have nobody to share this with and i found it really sweet amp  x200b amp  x200b edit thank you everyone i forwarded on the comments to my dad amp will also write to sb to name the branch amp hopefully they will get some worthy praise lt 3 also my dad has been incredible he has asperger s but the lengths he goes to to empathize with me is something i will always be thankful for sadly we have both had to go through this disordered journey over the past year or so but he is very supportive as stated i forwarded on everyone is compliments,1,349

anybody else feel like the only choices they have in life is to starve or be fat i do not feel like i have ever been able to have a healthy relationship with food as a kid i would say i ate normally always had a sweet tooth though which is something i have come to hate now then it feels like out of nowhere like literally overnight i lost all ability to eat normally no joke ever since around my 13th birthday were i suddenly developed a huge ass appetite it feels like i have completely lost the ability to eat normally in my teen years i would be insanely hungry all the time and eating entire bags of chips on the regular and taking large portion sizes at dinner because my stomach felt like this huge black hole i would not call them binges by any means because i could always stop when i was full and never felt out of control but for whatever reason my body kept demanding food eating a normal serving size of anything and feeling satisfied that ability stopped coming naturally to me at all at the time i did not think much of it and assumed it was because i was growing or whatever but looking back on it has made me flabbergasted it is a miracle i only became overweight at 17 and not any earlier and to be honest the reason why i was probably staying at a decent weight in my early teens while eating so much processed junk food is because i did not eat breakfast or even lunch very regularly not because of any disordered stuff back then i mainly skipped breakfast because i wanted to sleep in a little extra before school and now that the pendulum has swung in the other direction and i am in my early twenties and i have developed an ed lost all that extra weight and feel afraid of even perfectly reasonable healthy food it is made things more confusing it really feels like i have to live with this disorder that makes me miserable and cold and makes me miss out on seeing family and friends as a price to pay to stay skinny because if i did not and went back to eating more i would slide back into being overweight way too easily sorry if a lot of what i wrote seems disjointed and does not make much sense having a bit of a shit moment right now and mainly wanted to know if anyone else felt similiar and if i am wrong for never wanting to recover,1,441

i feel like family members who constantly badgered me about being chubby as a kid should not be allowed to express tearful concern that i am too skinny as an adult sorry that i over corrected a little too far for your taste i guess you really harped on how fat and disgusting i was during a super important time in my psychological development so i guess i just figured better safe than sorry really though do they realize that they had a substantial fault in my developing an ed are they crying out of guilt do they ever wonder if they would just minded their own business and not bullied an elementary school child about her baby fat if i would have a healthy relationship with weight and food are they crying for the reasons they should be crying because they feel terrible for the part they played in this or are they just throwing a tantrum again about my body not being the shape they think it should be just with tears and pleading for me to eat this time instead of insults and demands that i go on a diet in either case i find it incredibly insulting when the people who handed me my ed on a fucking platter have the audacity to cry at me about the body they used to constantly insult and poke at unless they are offering a well thought out and heartfelt apology then i am not here for it like sorry i do not have the emotional energy to fucking babysit you while you sob about my collar bones i am too busy counting calories and trying to find brands that carry clothes small enough to fit me because 20 years ago you felt it was necessary to body shame me when i was still under 5ft tall and had not even had the chance to grow tits ツ        so like   my weekend is booked,1,325

a nice thing that happened with my boss at work so at work today it was optional pajama day but i could not wear any because after my sudden weight drop none of them fit me so when i get in my boss was like where is your pajamas so i told her none of mine fit me anymore and she got confused and asked why and i have been trying to be a little more open about what is been going on without seeking treatment though and so i just got quiet and said because of my anorexia she got quiet for a minute then was like ok let us go to target and i just said oh no i do not have the money for target and she was like does not matter let us go there i just got a pair of toy story pants and when i went to pay she paid for me and looked at me and just said everyone deserves clothes that fit them at least it meant so much to me that she would go above and beyond like that for me just wanted to share a nice story from my sometimes lame workplace,1,202
my dad s cancer has cured me of liking thinspo i am 25 f and have struggled with binging restricting for about 4 years although this past year i have been semi recovered my dad got pancreatic cancer this year and lost a ton of weight he was so healthy and young he was a healthy weight and was working out every week going on walks all the time he was an athlete when he was in college and was always a big strong lumberjack man 3 months later and he looks like a shiveled old man all his muscles are gone his spine ribs are showing he is skin and bones he has a thigh gap super visible collarbones hip bones etc its weird because it reminds me of bonespo thinspo stuff and now i cannot look at a picture of an underweight person anymore without be so so sad and wishing they were healthy i keep thinking of how i cannot cuddle my papa anymore because he is in pain how he sleeps all the time because he is exhausted how he cannot enjoy his favorite meals because he is always trying to find something that does not make him throw up its just a weird time for me and it absolutely breaks my heart now when i see thinspo with tons of reblogs and likes and all i can see is a human who is slowly dying i just wanted to share in case it helped anyone or made someone feel less alone somehow pancreatic cancer is one of those where if you start feeling any symptoms you are already at stage 4 there is like 3 survival rate my dad s probably going to die in a few days weeks,1,294

i am offering free dental checkups to my girls in melbourne i know it is really hard to go in because of the fear of being judged since i have been there myself so i want to do my part for this community so there is a lot that can happen with eds including the erosion sensitivity and decay from all the damage we do to ourselves if you send me a private message i will make sure you are confidentially booked in to see me for a checkups with free xrays and some general oral health advice i struggled with bulimia my entire life so you know that there is absolutely zero judgement from me i have been through a lot with my ed and restrictions and erosion from purging to weight loss surgery which comes with a whole other set of problems related to nutrition and dental care i have seen everything there is to see you are safe with me i will never make you feel as though anything you have done is your fault or wrong i will just help you see the facts of what there is and how we can help mitigate any further damage i am sorry that i cannot really offer this outside my state but for those of you in melbourne when lockdown is over i can do my part and give back to this community that is been there for me from day 1 of when i got fired at my first job on my first day to when i started up my own clinic and began taking referrals from other dentists for complex cases they could not handle you are my people and i want to give back reach out to me whenever you feel ready edit i just realised i let my slang slip out in the title just to clarify this is absolutely not restricted to women   girls guys nonbinary you are all welcome we are all human and in this together,1,335
i miss not eating i miss the feeling of going to bed knowing i have not ate in 3 days i miss waking up knowing i lost so much weight over the night i miss the comments i would get about how much weight i have lost i miss stepping on the scale knowing that it is gone down i miss feeling dizzy when i got up from the lack of food i miss the feeling of eating food after a week long fast i miss the daily routine of vitamins and religiously gulping down bottles of water i miss my anorexia and i desperately want it back edit hey guys this got a lot more attention than it should have but i feel bad that so many people relate to this i am not ready for recovery at all but trust me going back to your anorexic ways is not going to make you feel better it will make you feel worse you probably only remember the highs but think about the lows as well,1,176
shoutout to my failed anorexics to anyone who is plagued by guilt over struggling to restrict and overpower their hunger cues to anyone who struggles to feel valid in their eating disorder but cannot shut it off enough to live and eat normally to anyone constantly on the verge of both recovery and relapse always teetering that line i see you i feel your pain you are valid,1,68

you look like you have lost weight nah i am just fluctuating between the same 15lbs i always am you just refuse to comment when i gain weight for the majority of my eating disorder my dad has commented that i look like i have lost weight a few times a year i have even told him that he never mentions when i have gained weight and that if i had lost weight every time he said so then i would be long dead so it is obvious that i have gained in between he just laughed and made jokes about how silly it would be to mention someone is weight gain in the same way that we mention weight loss yes do you not see the dichotomy do you not see the irony he did it again yesterday when i saw him and i have not stopped thinking about it since then he stared at my upper body and smiled with pride for a few seconds which was weird af my disordered brain is now saying if he is proud now then he will be so proud when you reach x lbs which is chaotic and idiotic he has always had issues with his weight and has always dated women with issues so he is surrounded by diet talk and can get pretty judgemental of people s bodies but especially women as if i give a shit that he thinks angelina jolie is too thin is it any wonder why i grew up obsessed with my body and was dieting from the age of 7 i was surrounded by misinformed diet culture and judgement about physicalities i just wish he understood the effect his comments and focuses have on people i wish he understood that not everyone looks at weight loss comments as a positive as he does and that it can be hurtful and uncomfortable i dread seeing him when i know i have lost weight now even though i love him and miss him no conversation with him about it ever sticks because he either forgets the conversation or it gets filtered through his own biases and he gets the wrong message from it or he just laughs it off edit i do not know why there is a bullet point in my title but it is driving me crazy,1,393
does anyone else absolutely adore their partner s imperfect body with a smitten rose colored love yet think that they need to look like a victoria s secret model in order to be adored back my partner has body acne he has a soft belly he is not 6 2 does not have much in the way of muscle definition and is bald but to me he is the most gorgeous man i have ever seen in my life the things i listed above are just incidental data points that do not mean anything when i look at him all i see are his deep green eyes his heart breaker smile and soft lips his expressive eyebrows and his huggable cozy arms i am literally smiling just thinking about how much i love him and how handsome he is and yet when i see myself in the mirror all i can see is my wide flabby waist and flat butt and nonexistent boobs and big nose and deep set eyes and all the extra fat hanging around my arms then i see videos of stick thin gorgeous girls dancing on tik tok or i see a girl in real life who is prettier and skinnier than me and i think how on earth could he love me or be attracted to me in good faith when there is people like that walking around i believe i need to be at my ugw and have pouty lips and perfect tits in order for him to really be attracted to me but when i flip the script on him in my head it is laughable my brain really does not like to use logic shake my head my head,1,287

i fucking hate what my mother did she is an absolute monster yesterday i came home from work and i noticed she cleaned my room two months ago i bought some nice picture frames because i wanted i have a lot of pictures with my friends i planned to frame my mother put pictures of me when i was at my lowest weight into the frames and put them on the fucking wall they are all over my room pictures where i looked deadly sick my bodychecks that no one was supposed to see when i asked her why she did that she told me because you looked so beautiful back then i told her i was dying and extremely deep in my ed i still have ed but not so bad she responded with i am just saying you looked better and that is the truth you do not want to hear,1,153
to the bone casting lily collins i am sorry but if they are goal was to show a realistic portrayal of anorexia without glamorizing it why would they cast a universally beautiful actress why would they dress her in the chic oversized dark clothes like it is tumblr aesthetic in my opinion they should have chosen a less conventionally attractive actress and styled her to be off closer to the weird unicorn girl at the residential place also at the beginning when she says suck my skinny balls you start off showing that she is cool chic gorgeous thin and then through the movie you see her struggles with anorexia i get there there were relatable non glamorized moments and maybe it is my own eating disorder talking but using lily collins to play a cool anorexic character just glamorized the disorder more for me,1,145
ed spaces like this sub generally do not trigger me much but when non disordered people in real life so much as talk about dieting and exercise i freak out why,1,31
i am so skinny aril fools i am a chungus,1,10
the pouch of fat is your ute shut up shut up shut up shut up not only is it a pad of fat that protects your internal organs your uterus is litwrally behind your bladder whrre is the logic where edit some people are confused so i feel like i should give context i posted this because of a post i saw on pinterest about how to remove lower belly pooch and the comments were full of people saying that it is normal because it is your uterus when it really is not i am aware that the fat is normal and necessary for protecting vital organs this was not me encouraging starving or anything i understand some people getting confused on this amp my apologies as i should have given context originally,1,133
does anyone else tell themselves they need to lose weight so they can see what their face really looks like under their face fat like fr i know that is not how that works it is my face and at every weight i have been my face does not change hardly at all but like what if my face was s k i n n y,1,66
why is it harder to stop eating than it is to just not eat at all it is like as soon as i consume something over 100 calories my brain flips a switch and i just start gorging myself on thousands of calories most of the time it does not even taste good i just need to eat and even if it is a plain tortilla that tastes like absolutely nothing i am still going to shove it in my mouth it is so stupid i am trying to recover but it is like i am just exchanging one eating disorder for another,1,103
the way people treat slightly chubby women makes me want to stay underweight i do not want to be treated like that sure i have had some negative comments about being too skinny but i am so fucking scared of gaining a healthy amount of weight then being told i look like a wine mom should not wear crop tops am disgusting need to lose weight ect,1,67
do not smoke as an appetite suppressant hey kids i have been using smoking as an appetite suppressant for 20 years now it is great right it also makes food taste less appealing so it seems like a win my doctor just found three masses in my lung i do not know if they are malignant yet but my doctor is concerned because of my history with smoking this is not a pity party it is just    you all do not be me do not do this to yourself i have never wanted to live as much as i do now realizing what i might have to do to make it through this,1,113
it amazes me how easy it is to recognize that someone has an eating disorder when you have an eating disorder i just realized that a girl that used to be my friend some years ago most likely had a restrictive eating disorder i do not know why but i was thinking about how she would get extremely upset if we wanted to go have dinner to an unusual place or how she would eat extremely slow while talking so much and offering us part of her food when we finished eating earlier than she did i had a healthy relationship with food at that time so i truly believed she had a small apetite and was a picky eater now when i think about it i think it was pretty obvious it is kind of funny how oblivious people without an eating disorder can be,1,146

let us talk about eds and racism tw specific numbers so i am a recovered anorexic teenage girl i am indian as well even at my lowest weight 39 kg at 170 cm i would get shocked stares but when i would explain that i was anorexic and to please refrain from commenting on my weight people would remark that i did not look like their image of an an patient but when a white girl at my school got anorexia people would constantly uplift her and support her in her recovery amp  x200b additionally every major film or book or any form of media about anorexia only depicts them in white girls there is no representation for us brown people or any other people of color when it comes to eds,1,132
it makes me happy when people i did not like growing up are putting on weight now i 22f know it is fucked up my ed has made me so rude about other body types but growing up i got bullied a lot now a lot of the girls who made my life a living hell in high school are getting bigger the worst one is my cousin who was the most popular girl in high school and the apple of my grandmas eye i saw a picture of her today and she is put on weight and it made me happy they are not even fat they have what you would consider normal usa women s body types instead of the rail thin look i have got going on i know it is fucked up but it is just this feeling of superiority i have lost weight since high school but they have put it on so i am better than them the thing is that it is been hell getting to this point i know that i should not feel good about it and that really i am the pathetic one here not them can anyone else relate,1,200
a rant about demi lovato who promoted sugar free pepsi at the bbmas tonight anyone who is narcissistic enough to make targeted defamatory posts towards a small mom and pop about diet culture to their tens of millions of followers all while making people with eds look like entitled karen s and then hold a microphone promoting zero sugar dr pepper a few weeks later deserves to be dressed down soda companies are literally the inventors of toxic diet culture yet demi is fine parading down a red carpet funded by them and holding a mic branded to sell a diet drink demi is amoral narcissistic and above all performative they are only an activist when it concerns them and it sickens me to see them being hailed as a hero to those with eds and the body positivity moment we do not act like this edit fixed the pronouns apologies,1,151

why is it why is it that when a baby eats 600 calories they are eating enough to grow but when i do it it is an eating disorder literally cannot deal with the double standards in this society shake my head,1,42
just a reminder not to believe anyone that tells you i have not eaten anything all day for some people it might just mean they had a light lunch for some people skipped breakfast and for other people that all they had was a 450 calorie drink for some people nothing beside the 800 calories worth of snacks throughout the day my point is just normal people do not have the same conception of what certain expressions mean do not let this invalidate you and do not compare yourself to others,1,91
some drunk girl apologizing for being skinny around me a few months ago i was at a friend s house and his roommate and roommate s gf were there i had let myself go a little bit back on restriction mode now but the roommates gf was one of those completely natural fast metabolism girls that is just stick thin and perfect so after a few drinks i went outside to smoke a cigarette and she followed me out there she began asking if i was okay and said that i seemed a little uncomfortable i said no i am just a little tired and her drunk ass actually said i just do not want you to feel insecure around me so many girls feel weird around me because i am just so skinny and it makes a lot of people self conscious like you are really pretty i just want to make sure you do not hold it against me that i am so much thinner than you lmaoooo i do not even have to elaborate on how i felt after that because i am sure you all can imagine,1,191
my boyfriend just made me a fear food meal in a safe way i have not eaten in two days he knew he mentioned a grilled cheese and tomato soup one of my all time favorites i reluctantly agreed my stomach growled loudly when he mentioned it so he made me a grilled cheese and some soup he heated up my safe tomato soup used 0 cal cooking spray instead of butter like he usually does and just made a baby sandwich one slice of bread cut in half it was more than i had planned on eating but he did everything he could to make it safer for me without me even asking he is not perfect but damn this feels like a victory for both of us in a weird way,1,133
i told my boss about my ed just after christmas i took some time off work and my ed spiralled out of control vacation turned into a medical leave of absence for the last 8 months i found a great ed specialist who took on my case and was able to get into and graduate an outpatient program during my leave today i emailed my boss explaining my sudden departure from work and that i would be interested in coming back part time while being under the supervision of a dr before returning to my stress inducing management position if i maintain my weight and mental status during this return then i can go back full time i received a reply within 20 minutes my boss is absolutely thrilled that i took time off to get the help i needed and there may be other opportunities within the company or i can go back to my original role that the workplace has not been the same without me and she has been hoping and praying that i would get better i am just on my first true attempt at recovery at the age of 25 and you all on this sub have inspired me to want to get better and for that i cannot thank you enough,1,217

if i ask you not to take photos of me do not take fucking photos of me i literally cannot stand to see pics vids of myself not like yikes haha that is a bad picture but like it actually really fucking upsets me and is super distressing and can send me spiralling and will destroy my mood for days even a couple years ago the day i got my senior photos back in hs i ended up with alcohol poisoning in the er getting a psych eval because it made me so depressed i drank myself nearly to death if i am out with people and someone takes a picture of me i feel like i just shut down like any happiness just gets sucked out of me when i am reminded of how i look if i see someone trying to take one i literally have to cover up my face and as much of myself as possible while begging for them to stop so why does no one ever respect when i say do not take a picture the number of times i have unexpectedly seen myself on someone else s snap story and had to plead with them to remove it or friends who randomly send me pics they took of me when i was not paying attention like hm just going to check snap aaaaaand i am miserable now or the girls who want to take selfies together and will not take no for an answer even just the other day hanging out with my friend and her boyfriend he refused to stop trying to take dumb little videos of us until i was literally curled up with my face in my knees and my hands covering my head and his girlfriend made him stop i hate it because i always seem like i am the one being difficult or who killed the vibe but if people just respected the first time i told them not to then this would not have been an issue but everyone thinks they can like convince me people are always like stop oh c mon you look fine i will not even send it to anyone please you do not even know anyone on my acc i do not have many friends i promise why please why will not you it is just me stop just come take one like why cannot you take no for an answer or i have met quite a few people who found out i hated pictures and then would turn it into their game to try and take pictures of me before i could cover my face or grab their phone away it is not fucking funny that you got me people are like but you take selfies though uhm yes at one very specific angle in good lighting fully makeup ed and with a filter because that is the only way i can feel remotely good about myself for 6 seconds god i know i am annoying and i seem like a brat but it really just fucking breaks my heart every time i have to see a picture of myself and i wish people would just stop trying to force me to,1,541
a tip for all you binge eaters out there trying to stop as given to me by my therapist she called it the rule of 3s basically make a list of safe foods i e foods you general do not binge on and feel safe eating and a list of non safe foods i e foods you tend to binge on or do not feel comfortable eating next make a list of safe places aka places you do not generally binge like a restaurant or in public with your friends and non safe places like your room alone lastly make a list of safe times times you are less likely to binge for me it is the morning or afternoon and non safe times times you are more likely to binge for me it would be evening or late at night from now on 2 3 of those things need to be safe whenever you eat anything not in a safe place if you are going to eat it has to be a safe food and at a safe time not eating a safe food you bet your ass you have to eat it in a safe place and at a safe time as long as 2 3 are safe challenge yourself with something not safe not only does this encourage eating non safe foods in a healthy way it really helps deflect a binge if you stick to it i hope this helps you all as much as it is been helping me,1,254

thebiggestratever might look prettier when she weighs more alarming new data shows recent observations seem to reveal some alarming news thebiggestratever s face might look nicer when she weighs more the study which drew solely from the mental illness addled mind of the subject seems to indicate that when the subject is bordering on a normal weight her face looks better than when she is considerably skinnier i hate it here said thebiggestratever when asked about the study i am going to move into the middle of the forest and live with the bears,1,94
debunking super low metabolisms tw numbers but they might make you feel better okay i am really sick of pseudoscience and people trying to further trigger themselves so i am here to debunk all this shit for you guys your metabolism at its lowest is likely to be around 1000 cals assuming you are anorexic and underweight none of that 600 800 bs it is harmful to tell others that their bmr can be that low it makes people believe they have to low restrict and whatnot you are not invalid if you do restrict to those low numbers but i am tired of people arguing that a full body scan is super accurate and you have to believe their specific anecdote about the bod pod scan they got done it is never going to be totally accurate because it is not your beloved dexa scans always underestimate your bmr so there is no way i believe that your bmr is below 900 cals furthermore indirect calorimetry the method used in the first study has high variability in the ill population and time of day food and water intake heartrate blood pressure and breath rate all impacts those readings just note that in the first study i cited those at the lowest end of 4000 kj burned at rest did no exercise like sitting around maybe some neat was calculated into it but no exercise not even walking i am studying medicine and have done independent studies in undergrad on this stuff while being super anorexic still am lmaooo but to keep promoting low metabolisms and say you will gain weight if you restrict to 800 cals is bs and i am 4 8 and underweight so you would be hardpressed to find someone shorter than me and with a lower metabolism and i still lost weight on 800 cal a day sorry if this is aggressive i am trying to save some lives here,1,325
do not start drugs a rant this might get me downvoted into oblivion but quite frankly i do not care if you have not gotten into drugs do not get into it because of the appetite suppressing effects and the category of drugs includes but is not limited to nicotine cocaine abuse of adderall etc it is not worth it people will tell you about the weight loss they do not tell you about the financial emotional physical and mental long term toll these substances have on you i do not care that i sound preachy and annoying please please please just do not get mixed up in it we are all out here struggling but drugs are not the answer i know we all out here doing things that are not super healthy for us but please do not do it do not try it remember when you thought this ed was going to be a short term weight loss solution look how that turned out drugs are not something to mess around with please do not do it edit i am floored by y alls response to this i really did not think anybody would care about my rant hahaha it really warms my heart to see you all looking out for each other a huge thank you to everyone who has shared their own stories and experiences and has offered advice as always please take care of yourselves if you ever need to chat i am always open,1,251

i hate art of fat girls because they are always drawn a certain way so when i used to have tumblr a lot of people were really into the whole drawing fat people body positivity and stuff which is fine i guess however every time they draw a fat girl for representation she usually has a small jawline a perfect pear hourglass figure teeny tiny ankles big eyes conventionally attractive features large breasts a flat stomach or a cute squishy precious marshmallow fluffy stomach seeing art that looked like that really messed with my self esteem because even though i am fat seeing those drawings just made me feel worse because i do not have perfect proportions like they do as a fat girl i am only attractive if i am a good fat girl do not even get me started on the fact that they only ever drew fat women and not men but whatever i want to be skinny because i have a weird body type and maybe i will actually be attractive if i am not as huge as i am now anyway fuck tumblr and their beauty standards,1,192
it is easier to just not eat than to eat restrictively if i have even just a piece or a bite of something i will keep eating and eating and eating until it is gone i prepared some safe and tasty dinners for the week and i was feeling really good about them and then i went and ruined it i work an extremely physically demanding job in a kitchen with no breaks and broken air conditioning i spend the whole night feeling miserable but i am surrounded by food that i can turn to for easy comfort there is a pan of golden salty chips just sitting there on the table staring at me i tell myself do not do it save the calories for your safe dinner but then i take one and then i am eating chips for the entire 8 hour shift so when i get home i have no calories left for my safe dinner i eat a sugar free jello because it is cold and soft and it is all i can have and i go to bed starving and hurting and that is my punishment for eating nothing but useless calorie dense trash i wish i could just not eat i get so hungry between my meals i have to eat something or i will faint but it is so hard it is hard and no one understands i am leaving this job at the end of the month but right now it is hard,1,252
does anyone else feel skinny in their home but when they go out they feel huge my brain tells me that how i feel when i am outside is how i actually am and what i feel at home is a lie,1,42
the world treats you better when you are skinny even when you are too skinny i just saw a post in which someone complained that uw people have it the worst and people treat them awfully whereas ow people are not treated with the same malice uhm not to invalidate anyone s experience people are shit no matter what you look like but i promise you this ow or thick people or what not are 100 worse off this is not the oppression olympics sure but please just look around you know that fatness is so villainzed otherwise we all would not be sitting here struggling with food and self image the majority of us in this subreddit want to be thin and you know it maybe this is a very emotionally charged post but i am tired of the woe is me i have been on both sides of the scale people would talk over me would stand in a cirlce in a way that would exclude me would invalidate my feelings not care about my opinion or outright ridicule my opinion when i was on the heavier side and do not even get me started on the dating aspect the threatment is worlds apart with how everyone acted when i was my thinnest and i am not the only one that can attest i have talked to numerous people whose weight has fluctuated a lot and they will tel you the same thing even when you spew the dumbest thing you can muster if you are skinny someone listens we all know the beauty standard it is engraved in our brains and we all know it is thinness especially now that 90s and 2000s styles are coming back and people wear low rise jeans and crop tops especially now that asian media is merging with western media now that kpop is popular wherein idols are all underweight especially now that summer is coming or has come and we are all expected to wear less and show more and everyone is talking about beach bodies anyways edit i just hope you all know that i am not saying that the troubles ridicule pain bullying etc you received directly because of your thinness weren t real they 100 were but saying it is the same as or even worse than what ow people deal with is like comparing apples with oranges faphobia is systemic and denying that is silly yes it all depends on where exactly you live and what kinds of people you are surrounded with as well as age gender etc it can vary but the majority of the world is fatphobic i can easily mention more than just the plain ridicule and disrespect like the little amount of options of clothes to choose from or the little to no healthy representation in media etc but i digress i think it is easiest understood if you like many have been on both sides of the scale as well and unless you have never been there you will not understand the gravity of our words,1,516
noo do not compare yourself to instagram models they use photoshop and angles to make them look thinner you are beautiful in your own way bitch who said i compare myself to insta models i compare myself to the skinny girls who sit next to me in class do they use photoshop in real life too huh i do not care about online pictures but whenever i see a skinny girl in real life i want to burst into tears,1,80

there is a girl in front of me studying next to a chocolate chip cookie she is been taking bites periodically over the course of a half hour in between bites she is able to study with it next to her without staring at it even while biting she keeps her eyes on her laptop like she does not care about the cookie a chocolate chip fell off inside the bag and i do not think she will eat it or even notice that it exists i have not been able to look away i mean how do you     like why are    is that even      what how do you get to be that way,1,114
i am so tired of guys denying that women are underweight just because they think they are hot i am seriously so done your dick is not an eating disorder detector our bmi is not measured by whether you find us bangable or not so freaking tired of seeing visibly underweight bodies treated as average  healthy  you are just used to overweight bodies because america blah blah blah i like how it looks too cannot help it but i am not deluding myself that natalia dyer is not vastly underweight because i think she is pretty edit to clarify she is just a common reddit example not my current gripe strange how i have never seen gay bi women do this sorry to rant just urgh hate how everyone is so concerned about us being over or under weight until they find it attractive on someone,1,146
2000s thin is coming back i was on the kuwtk subreddit and there was a picture of kim looking so unbelievably skinny in one of her italy outfits mind you most people who meet kim in real life before always talked about how tiny she was but now after losing 16 pounds even khloe has gotten much skinnier than before the kardashians deserved or not were the ones who brought being curvy to the mainstream and seeing them lose their curves a bit is confirming my theory that the 2020s beauty standard will be stick thin,1,96
yesterday i deleted all the thinspo on my phone 3000 photos today it is my birthday and my partner made me pancakes in bed with maple syrup and i ate them all zero guilt very good week so far edit thank you so much for all the birthday wishes and congratulations i just checked back today and you have all made me smile so much,1,65
the girl on my boyfriend s lock screen lying down next to me in bed while i alternate between my ed subreddits and hello kitty phone game my boyfriend takes out his phone on his lock screen a girl is staring at me smiling i do not recognize her but i guess she looks a bit like me though her skin is glowing her hair long and healthy gt  her thighs squish together  lt as she sits on the bed but it looks cute on her she looks very happy and healthy i cannot help but draw comparisons between the girl in the photo and myself besides the obvious difference of our bodies i am just so dull compared to her my hair is just as long but much thinner her full cheeks frame her carefree smile while my sunken face is adorned with disgusting chapped lips and grotesque teeth i muster up the courage to suggest he change the photo i pull up my favorite recent photo of myself i have my clip in hair extensions in and i like the way my elbows look that is okay he says this is my favorite picture of you but the girl in that photo is not me that bright eyed 23 year old who went all in for recovery to push herself through beauty school who ordered gt  an impossible burger and fries  lt at our three year anniversary dinner that night became a hollowed out she will of herself who gt  eats trail mix out of measuring cups  lt and cannot get out of bed because she is too cold it feels like looking at a photo of a stranger or someone who died but it is just me two and a half years ago i am still here breathing living looking at this photo but i was too blinded by sickness to see the beautiful girl in the mirror until she became nothing more than the girl on my boyfriend s lock screen,1,335
i will never forget when my therapist said imagine depriving your 5 year old self from food like this and i said let that little bitch starve if i was taught portion control and was not fed like a pig i would not have all these problems,1,47
lpt always assume that i have not eaten anything today is a lie bf have you eaten today me yeah bits and pieces here and there bf like what me two eggs some fruit and a chicken tender bf whaaat that is not bits and pieces that is p l e n t y a whole meal i have not eaten a n y t h i n g today me bf absolutely n o t h i n g me looks around room gaze settles on large bowl still filled with dregs of instant noodle soup upon further probing we realize that to the best of our knowledge he is eaten a whole pack of instant ramen noodles plus a truly gigantic brownie i say we realize because when i point the evidence out to him he tells me he forgot he also opens the freezer and starts eating ice cream as we are talking psa i have not eaten anything i have not eaten as much as i usually do normal people do not care about caloric content normal people are easily fooled by frequency and volume when normal people say they have not eaten anything and make a big deal out of your eating do not freak out do not feel bad carry on with your day thank you,1,222
anyone only feel skinny when they are hungry yesterday i restricted my calories and the entire day i felt so confident like my legs felt thin and my stomach was flat and i chewed gum instead of eating snacks and all that lovely restriction shit today i woke up ravenous and ate above maintenance and i did not massively binge i just ate a completely normal amount of calories but i feel huge and disgusting now i am more aware of every roll on my body and i feel gross i know this amount of food is healthy for me but i feel so   huge i am just so tired of not knowing how big small i actually am i just want to borrow a pair of someone else s eyes to see me through them because depending on how much i ate that day i look in the mirror and see different things,1,154
all the grimes only ate spaghetti and her hair started falling out how quirky and silly jokes ever since that grimes wieiad vid came out a long time ago people started joking about how she is soooo unhealthy and only ate spaghetti for so long that she became malnourished so silly like yes because she has an eating disorder i guess it really is not obvious to normies at all because if someone is not eating lettuce and carrots they are just unable to see an ed even if you are eating one plate of spaghetti a day like grimes was it is just omggg what a glutton only eating junk food it literally happened to me too i went through this weird several month long phase where my only safe foods were this one instant packet of rice noodles and bagels everyday id eat one packet of noodles and one bagel on the side and everyone in my house knew i was only eating that but just thought i was like a junk food addict instead of thinking i was undereating lmfao junkorexics will forever be misunderstood,1,188

genuine thank you to whomever reported my hopeless post i made a really hopeless post a couple of days ago which i deleted shortly thereafter out of embarrassment sharing how i felt like i had hit rock bottom with no desire to climb back up some kind soul recognized where i was at emotionally and reported it to reddit support who reached out sending a message full of resources i decided to take the dive and text the hotline and last night had my first session with my new therapist i really and truly appreciate it thank you for helping me hang in there kind stranger,1,106

i am just going to say it you all should not date guys who constantly like instagram models pics edit to the cool girls in my comments i do not care if you disagree and there is nothing wrong with girls who feel this way i have seen so many posts and comments about this girls upset because their boyfriend or guy they like follows a ton of instagram models famous female tiktok ers skinny girls big booty girls whatever the case and they themselves look nothing like that honestly i find it sad if a grown man does that shit i would be embarrassed if my friends and family saw my following list and it is full of porn stars or something do they have no shame no they do not if he is a teen it is more understandable but if you all are out of high school and still like men like this it is not worth it we have to remember that the majority are heavily edited even videos there is body filters often times very subtle filters as well that most people would not notice if you do not want to admit this fine let us pretend they do not use filters it is still embarrassing for a man to simp over girls online they would not look at him twice and here he is like in her comments maybe you are thinking well that is every guy right maybe it is i am waiting for a cute guy who does not have social media or at least only follows boring shit like car guys or something if this guy does not exist and i have to be single so be it i will never lose sleep over instagram again if you fr have to argue with a man over this he does not deserve to have you we have enough shit to deal with in this life you do not need any man who makes you feel bad in any way you do not have to pretend to be the cool girl who is totally chill with your bf watching porn or looking at instagram models i am not chill i am crazy and that is fine by me,1,375

you think you are faking it you think you are faking this ok prove it delete tumblr delete myfitnesspal delete any and all calorie tracking apps go into your kitchen right now get up and walk into your kitchen now make a pot of pasta or spaghetti or make a salad with chicken or a smoothie or make a few eggs with some potatoes or heat up the leftovers in the fridge do not count it do not measure it do not look up the calories then sit down and eat the whole thing do not cut it up small do not wait until a certain time do not stare at it for forever before you eat it cook it put it on a plate and eat it maybe scroll through instagram or watch a tv show while you eat like a post on your explore page about loving pizza without thinking of the calories or feeling fat when you are done eating do not go to the mirror do not go to the scale do not go to the toilet to throw up then go on with your life without thinking about what you just ate or when you will eat next now do that every time you first feel hungry every single day for the rest of your life if you can do that fine i will believe you you are faking it but if even one step of that sounds like your own personal hell shut up because you are absolutely not fake and your problems are beyond valid and you deserve to recover right now right where you are found this on tumblr i will give credit to the account if people ask,1,287
seeing a few posts about people s partners and wanted to address something like it says lately i have noticed a few more posts than usual or maybe its just me of people venting about lack of support from their partners the part i want to address however is that lately it seems people are looking for an absolutely unrealistic selfish or unhealthy type of support if your partner listens to you vent tries to offer advice but tells you it stresses them out when all you talk about is your eating disorder that is on you that is them trying to be supportive and set boundaries to maintain their own mental health they cannot support you if they are entirely burnt out they are also a human being that has feelings and triggers and boundaries and you cannot expect them to put all of themselves aside for you 110 of the time that is absolutely unsustainable and unhealthy if your partner listens to you vent and tries to encourage you to recover or eat or whatever that is not them fucking sabotaging you that is them being a person who does not have an eating disorder and is doing their best your partner wants you to be better to feel better you can and should talk to them when you are stressed let them know your triggers and what helps you but expecting them to be a dumping ground for you to cry and vent at nonstop unconditionally every day and not talk about anything else of course they want to go out to dinner they love you and want to spend time with you doing something nice of course they want to go shopping see family watch movies literally anything it is not about your eating disorder it may affect it and that is on you to establish with them in a constructive way but it is so unbelievably unrealistic and selfish to assume and expect another human being to put their entire life wants and needs aside for you one hundred percent of the time this does not mean do not talk to them i have cried into my own partner gone into hysterics had fits over dinner but he and i also have a communication line open where one can say i want to support you but am in a bad headspace to do so and an understanding that emotional emergencies are different than just needing to vent it is a two way street the amount of support you are asking for needs to be close to or equal to what you are willing to give i am not as mentally well as my partner he supports me emotionally more than i support him but if he were to reach out and say he needed something from me or needed a break from me that is well within his right and i would support that they are not your therapist they are not your caretaker they also need support from you your partner is not your therapist your partner is not your therapist your partner is not your therapist oh my god thank you for reading this is such a personal gripe for me carry on edit before anyone even says it oh my god of course this does not apply to abusive relationships of course not and each dynamic is different and you will find your own balance do not me this is a rant about people expecting fulltime therapy from partners who are trying to set healthy reasonable boundaries,1,595
i want my weight loss to be significant but i want no one to notice like tell me that i am skinny and that i have lost a lot of weight but also if you ever mention my weight or my body or my corporeal existence ever i swear i will cry so hard at you,1,56
when did not eating become so normalized i was on tiktok and came across a video where a guy was like we need to make a support group for boyfriends with girlfriends that do not eat and how he would ask his girl if she ate and she would say today i thought the comments would be blowing up like oh that is not good and if that is consistent it could be an eating disorder nope the majority of comments were girls like oh my god this is me like i cannot even remember when i last ate maybe yesterday i just never eat like fuck me lmaooooo i have had issues with heavy restricting and bingeing for over a decade now i have also definitely had days where i genuinely did not even realize i did not eat if i was super busy life happens but for it to be consistent and people seeing themselves as quirky for not eating uughh honestly it triggered a really competitive part of me it got me thinking why am i eating if no one else is but i was also sad for those that do eat well some people in the comments were straight up asking wow after looking at these comments am i the only one that eats like damn i do not want more people to think they have to go through this hell i am tired you all,1,240

i took my mum down a notch the other day for sharing dieting stuff with her anorexic daughter me and just realized it was quite the power move my mum knows i have a history with anorexia she does not know i have it right now because she would not really handle the info responsibly but she noticed i lost weight even asked if i am sick again and is getting all competitive with me while i was baking brownies a new safe recipe i discovered and had a lot of pleasure with she messaged me how much weight she lost and how she is only eating salads now for lunch etc i was ready to just drop everything and skip my brownies but i thought to myself not now not today because i literally had just discovered the recipe and i have not had brownies in a year she will not ruin this for me so i wrote her good for you and then sent her a pic of my brownies saying but i will have these today she immediately added is not that a bit much for you and i responded no i might actually eat all of these by myself they are breakfast brownies with oats and everything so eating a large one or two would be appropriate but i did not even feel like explaining that to her let her think that i am devouring an entire tray of normal sugary buttery brownies and even if they were so what i do not care i just wanted to show her that i really do not care how she irresponsibly shares her unhealthy diet habits with her anorexic daughter eat your salad i will carry on with my brownies and not be distracted or intimidated by your need to engage in competition with me i will not give you approval i will not swap my brownies for salad she ghosted me after this so i guess i won edit brownie recipe i added oats,1,337
hello american friends put your extra election calories on my count tonight tomorrow if you need to eat drink to handle the stress of the 2020 election do not feel bad about it you deserve something extra for dealing with absolute clownery as a canadian i am also stressed but not nearly to the level i am sure you all are at if you need to direct message someone your rants or your panics feel free you deserve food without guilt even if the world feels like it is on fire amp  x200b not sure if this kind of post is allowed but i have seen them before when i was going through stress and it helped me a surprising amount stay safe please edit thanks for all of the love being spread in this post and thank you for all of the dms i will respond to them as quickly as possible hope everyone stays as calm as possible,1,160
thanks body positivity for aggressively reminding me i have a body like i know it works for some people but for me it is   wildly triggering it is okay to have a big belly it is okay to have squishy thighs well i was minding my own business being semi recovered and now you are making me panic because i was not thinking about my stomach and thighs and words like big soft and squishy are really not helpful contributors you do not need to lose weight you do not even know who i am what if i weighed 700 lbs you would have no idea also do not tell me what to do you clown my mind runs on reverse psychology,1,122
let us share our most ridiculous ed moments to feel slightly less bad about ourselves i had once mustered my strength and decided to let my mom cook lunch and just eat whatever i got served it was so hard and scary but i told to myself that it was needed then i saw her pouring cream onto the sauce that was too much long story short i threw an absolute hissy fit and ran away literally ran away it was winter so i ran for like 4 miles in full winter clothing hey it burns more calories and i ended up having lunch in an upscale buffet where i only had a couple plates of undressed steamed veggies for something like 15 dollars no i am not making this up,1,131
damn some of you all have some shitty boyfriends that is it that is the post i will be reading comments here or on peach and one of you lovely people will be like i ventured into the kitchen for the first time in 3 days to allow myself a glass of celery water and my boyfriend who is normally v sweet screamed at me not to be such a fucking pig and now i do not want to eat any more but that is just how he is sometimes and you do not deserve any of that i know some of you are consciously or unconsciously staying in abusive relationships as a form of meanspo to trigger yourselves but you all deserve to get the fuck out it is so much better when you do if any of you are waiting for a sign to break it off with someone who fuels your ed then this is that sign it does not matter how good things are when they are good someone who makes you feel badly about fuelling your body is someone who does not have your best interests at heart,1,193
anyone else completely pissed off about your ed being reduced to wanting to look good for men honestly so tired of those men do not like skinny girls and super skinny bodies are not fashionable anymore prophets like i have just come across some dude s bio on okcupid that says i will like it if you check one or more of these boxes you understood that men prefer normal women not skinny models and accept and like your body thanks jan i am cured i was in the mood for pointless arguments so i told that dude that is it is not about men it is about our vision of ourselves that is warped dude had the audacity to answer what is it about if it is not to look attractive then i blocked laughing out loud edit thanks for the awards amp all your answers,1,147

last night i got so high i completely forgot i had an eating disorder i was laying in my bed watching my endless youtube watch later queue and someone in the video brought up eating disorders and as she talked about it describing every symptom of mine i was like wow i am so glad i do not have an eating disorder that sounds so sad and i got up to use my bathroom and passed by my trash can full of c s up food and was like oh,1,90
my ten year old daughter told me it was ok to stop eating at thanksgiving dinner tonight i piled way too much food on my plate as always and i just kept eating it i stopped and kind of stared at it for a second and from across the table my daughter said mom you do not have to finish that i can see you are not hungry it is ok to stop eating i grew up in a household where you did not get to plate your own food but you did not leave the table until every last bite was gone i got sick after almost every meal i know that is what lead to mia in my adulthood i do not why this struck me so hard i think that was the first time in my life someone has said that to me and it came from my daughter the fact that she noticed i did not want to eat anymore but kept going i feel guilty but so proud of her she is so much smarter than i ever was,1,184
i do not know what title to put here but this is something that happened yesterday when i get really fucking hungry and i feel like i cannot continue restricting anymore i order a shit ton of food then i unpack all of it and look at it and take in the aroma i then repack it and give it to the homeless dudes who live nearby i feel really great after this activity because i am able to continue my fast and feed people who actually need it i had not done this in 2 3 months now so i had not met the homeless guys for that time yesterday i did it again they saw me for the first time in 2 3 months and they seemed really concerned they said i looked like i needed the food more than them they made me sit and eat along with them normally when i eat a lot of food i purge it but not yesterday i could not bring myself to throw it up because those guys did a really nice gesture even though they needed it much more than me and i did not want it to go to waste i guess this is a start to something,1,210
i just ate a big spoonful of peanut butter after tracking my calories for today and realizing they were too low i even had to re brush my teeth edit thank you everyone for being so supportive,1,37
oh my god bella hadid finally admitted that she is one of us she also confirmed that she had a nose job when she was 14 from the vogue article gt when bella was in high school a psychiatrist prescribed extended release adderall for her inattention thinking it might simply be adhd she says that the appetite  suppressant effect of stimulant medication pushed her into anorexia i was on this calorie counting app which was like the devil to me she remembers i would pack my little lunch with my three raspberries my celery stick i was just trying i realize now to feel in control of myself when i felt so out of control of everything else these days bella has a very healthy relationship with food but she says the dysmorphic feelings persist i can barely look in the mirror to this day because of that period in my life not sure if i buy that she is fully recovered but wow it is nice that she was brave enough to be honest i am the same height as bella so she is been a huge source of comparison for me,1,193
beginning to think i might have misunderstood when people told me to eat my fruits and veggies turns out i am supposed to eat other things too here i was eating nothing but cucumbers and frozen blueberries but apparently this whole time i was supposed to be getting pro teen and new tree ants i think i spelled those right sounds like a scam to me have you all heard of this,1,72
recovery accounts are cringy as hell there i said it maybe it is an unpopular opinion but i do not find them motivating at all they still are fixated with food as they film themselves eating doing this face and post photos of their recovery body and then they tell you how much of a brave warrior you are for eating a piece of bread it actually makes me never want to recover i think it is way more inspiring when you just leave all the ed bs behind and start living like a normal person and do not try to look like an idol or inspiration just talk about your hobbies and friends and do not just post photos of your oatmeal with biscoff spread,1,126
the normalization of 1200 kcal diets makes me feel like my ed cannot be that bad i know that in reality that 1200 is an completely inadequate amount for me and probably most people but because i so often see women thinking they can eat maintenance around 1200 1400 while going to the gym it becomes more difficult to remember that this can be disordered too if everyone says 1200 is a perfectly normal amount to eat i cannot possibly be disordered when i hit that number right logically i know that is wrong but the minute i go over that number i feel like a fake edit thanks everyone for discussing this with me in my head i know exactly that 1200 is not enough but my ed brain still attacks me over it recent nutrition course i took actually used 2400 kcal a day as the average tdee for a non pregnant woman so the knowledge is there but lacking some good mh hearing you reflect on it really helps edit 2 there are so many illuminating example in the comments thank you it is been a good reminder for me how a lot of tdee information online and diet culture in general really underestimates a woman s daily calorie needs,1,213

my coworkers you are lucky you can eat whatever you want and not gain a single pound what                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        not gain                                      but eat               what i want bitch if you only knew,1,30

tmi but i am just going to say it jacking off despite you are non existent libido in an attempt to generate some modicum of warmth is valid i am not accepting constructive criticism send tweet,1,36
literally nothing irritates me more than people who gain weight and are just thicc without a stomach or rolls and dare to claim body positivity people who are all about body positivity and acceptance post pictures of themselves in bikinis and outfits no belly no rolls i am like okay briana when you cannot believe you would ever be this weight you just get a fatter ass and bigger tits you still have the same smooth body but it is just bigger when i gain weight it is rolls and gut fuck off with body positivity if you still look fucking amazing at a bigger size fuck you for loving yourself when you objectively look stunning and have a model physique that is no struggle i will bet you a million fucking dollars if you got my body type weight distribution at a bigger size you would be shoving your fingers down your throat too fucking bet intermittent fasting is going great how are you guys edit to expound on my very frustrated rant i think there is still a tremendous amount of gate keeping when it comes to society s body positivity movement the irony is not lost on me do not worry within that movement i think some bodies are widely accepted and praised because they have certain characteristics a flat stomach being one of the most important ones to social media in my personal opinion it is much much easier for someone to be accepted by society s beauty model standards if they have these certain characteristics i am frustrated that i do not believe i have any of these characteristics so if i were to do the same thing i would not be held to the same level of beauty as someone with better physical attributes if you are upset with me because you think that i am disregarding the body positivity movement as a whole i am afraid that was not the intention of my post i meant to say some people have it easier in the eyes of social media than others it is frustrating to me that someone who seemingly has a really effortless and happy existence who posts about body positivity has had an easier struggle than i have because even if they had an ed their body will be more easily accepted than mine would be am i jealous obviously is my rant toxic yea rants usually are eds usually are,1,410

its soup season dickheads any food that keeps you that full for fkn hoursssss and tastes like actual liquid heaven and can be adapted to literally any dietery restrictions ever and can be made with any and all leftovers and is like gt  60 100  lt calories for a whole bowl is a godsend to be fucking worshipped i will not tolerate soup wars on my posts there is only one correct opinion and it is this one,1,78
the truth about pro anas and wannarexics now i do not support the encouragement of eating disorders at all anorexia bulimia bed orthorexia osfed none of those are jokes none of them are glamorous all eating disorders no matter how big or small you are rob you of your life it is offensive to look at pro ed blogs on tumblr or on twitter or websites wherever it is not okay in any way shape or form however no one who is genuinely healthy is pro ed no one who is genuinely healthy wants an eating disorder no one who has a genuinely healthy relationship with food and or their body is pro ed no one who has a genuinely healthy relationship with food and or their body desires an eating disorder yes even if an eating disorder seems self inflicted for attention that person likely already has underlying problems in their life eating disorders are first and foremost a mental illness based in chemical imbalances in the same way depression is anyone who has an eating disorder or disordered eating deserves help support love compassion and to recover even if you do not approve of their reasons even if you only high restrict even if you have not been struggling for that long even if you are fat even if you are male even if you are bipoc even if you have never been hospitalised even if you have never been tube fed or knocked on death s door even if you do not starve or restrict at all even if you have never had an exercise addiction even if you are or have been pro in the past even if you feel like or others have called you a wannarexic even if you have never done other typical eating disorder behaviours but instead engaged in less common ones anyone who has an eating disorder or disordered eating deserves to be listened to understood and recover and although at the end of the day i definitely do not condone pro ana mia or any romanticisation of eating disorders i believe that romanticising your own mental disorder is part of the disease it starts to consume your life so much that it becomes your identity and therefore the most and only special thing about you not in a glamorous way but you genuinely do not know who you are without the ed glorification of eating disorders is very likely to be a coping mechanism of disordered people typically of the younger crowd granted it is definitely not a healthy coping mechanism but i wish people would recognise that again i do not condone or support pro ed in any way i apologise for the long and kind of messy rant but i am tired and needed to get that off my chest,1,472
yea i think thin privilege is real and yes i want it that is all,1,15
i fucking hate ed tiktok i know a lot of people talk about this on this sub but just hear me out because i think i have a different take than i have seen in the past usually i think tiktok is a pretty fun application and just watch videos of animals doing cute things or people making dumb but still funny jokes recently i have been seeing a lot of ed content but the videos themselves are not what i have a problem with they have actually been pretty educational spreading awareness no body checking and generally not triggering stuff it is the comments on those videos that get me somebody could be talking about how harmful very clearly disordered behaviours are the most common ones i see are restricting all day and then binging at night having fear foods stuff like that and every single time like half the comments will be wait that is not normal i bet that 90 of the time the people saying those things know very well that it is not normal and want to flaunt how sick they are and how naturally ed behaviours come to them like jfc this is not the place for that you know how competitive eds are and you probably knew how triggering that was as you were typing it out but you still decided to say that to get that sweet validation at the expense of others who are also struggling i just hate the hehe is not mental illness so quirky narrative that is becoming so common the line between destigmitizing and romanticizing is not actually all that thin but people still decide to just leap right the fuck over it anyways,1,287
nothing makes me more sick then men with eating disorder fetishizes i was reading a reddit post and this mans girlfriend died because he had a fetishizes and just let her eat nothing without saying anything because he thought she looked hot i am sorry but if you have an anorexic girl fetish you need serious help like i am taking about serious serious help to me it is up there with the worst fetishizes the thing is in most fetishizes even if weird people can consent to it happening but i do not feel like an anorexic girl can do the same at the time i feel like if you encourage it you are killing her,1,117
fun fact when i was 14 i tried learning russian so my parents could not figure out what i wrote in my mainly ed diary lasted about 2 months before i decided that i cannot russian,1,36

anyone else used to be able to easily not eat for 10 24 hours or do a full day fast and even longer but now cannot even go 2 hours without feeling like eating something i was so good at this omad thing and intermittent fasting a few months ago id eat one thing at 12pm and that would be it these days i literally have so many cravings and end up eating 3 4 meals even though soom after i am just drowning in self hate i am like no i cannot eat more i do not deserve it but guess what i eat more someone please help,1,109
the older i get the less i wish to be the stick skinny girl but more of the healthy girl who has a fun life maybe because i have already been there already got to the super low bmi reached all my goals which truly just robbed me out of having fun and going out with friends got the thigh gap the prominent hip bones etc sure i felt more confident with wearing more clothes and looked good from the outside i am going to of course but food and calories were my life and i had nothing outside of that it still kind of consumes most of my life but i have gained like 7 pounds during this quarantine and am trying to do self recovery and honestly whenever i see an extremely skinny woman that kind of reminds me of how i used to be i kind of have empathy now more than jealousy it used to be fucking shit i wish i was that skinny but now i think i know you are not ok i know you are always cold fighting that hunger restricting your calories by restricting the value of your life the relationships you could have the experiences you could cherish etc i hope you are ok even if you do not have an ed i am 27 now and this quarantine really has gotten me to think what i really want the rest of my life to be yeah the healthy woman might be fuller not have an extreme thigh gap but still takes care of herself and works out eats healthily most of the time she does not think twice about getting a donut from the break room because she knows she can have them whenever she wants she can have one or two donuts and be ok and not feel the need to finish the entire box because she is well nourished and not starved she can go get last minute brunch with her friends and be excited to see her friends not be anxious about it because she already ate her breakfast and did not plan for it or try to come up with an excuse to not go i am jealous of the women who can go to farmers markets with their friends and eat the samples and not tally up the calories from it i am jealous of how they have an active social life and can enjoy wine and a charcuterie board every now and then without starving themselves the whole day for it or flaking the last minute who can order pizza and have a date night in watching netflix and enjoy a couple slices then move on with their life there is sooo much more but that is what i can think of right now,1,470

we get it you are completely recovered that is why you will not stop uploading photos of you at your lowest weight right to warn others you constantly upload your old body checks because to advise how eds look like for awareness right yeah we totally need so many photos of you at your lowest weight sarc,1,57

i saw a women at the supermarket very obviously malnourished buying exactly the same foods i would buy to binge purge and restrict between my heart hurt so much for her she was probably in her 30s but looked far older everyone with an ed can recognise the signs especially in her face she was wearing baggy clothes that covered most of her body my bf saw me looking and when we left he said are you ok i think i saw what you saw it is so sad but you are going to be ok it is such a fear of mine letting myself carry on with a lifestyle that will result in something similar i just wanted to stop her and give her a hug but i know that is totally out of the question i would die of embarrassment if someone did something like that to me what really got me was that i have bought shopping identical to hers the same bags filled with bakery goods icecream fizzy drinks jams and so on and then plain salad it was spooky and i really hope she finds some peace the one thing i thought was at least she has some salad and avocados maybe she is not given up completely maybe she is still trying to keep down some food i felt so much when i saw her so frail and tired i am still thinking about her even days later this illness is so awful,1,249
i find physical hunger easier to deal with than mental hunger i do not know i might be confusing the two but i feel like i can resist eating easier when i am just physically hungry and i sort of like the feeling sometimes but when i get mental cravings its so much harder for me and i give in alot more often to them because they are so persistent and i just cannot stop thinking about the food i want does anyone else deal with this also if anyone has tips for chocolate cravings id highly appreciate because i feel like i crave chocolate 24 7,1,107

nobody actually cares if you have an eating disorder so you might as well talk about it nobody without an eating disorder thinks anorexia or bulimia is real anyway unless you are absolutely on the brink of death and god forbid you have a binge eating disorder because then you are just a fatty with no self control restrict all you want and nobody will worry as long as you are not an obvious bag of bones in fact they will just think you are vain and stuck up or applaud you for being so healthy nobody gives a fuck about making you uncomfortable with constant comments and jibes about your body so why should you care about potentially making them feel like assholes i announced today at work that i was going out to get some lunch a female colleague snidely remarked i thought you only ate one meal a day i told her that in fact i was not going to eat and only said that i was to shut her up because she could not keep her mouth shut for five seconds about my eating habits for once she had nothing to say,1,196
daes constantly feel the fat on their body everytime they walk or do anything i am not even overweight but everytime i walk i feel like a fatty blob and i feel every part of my body moving i hate this so much lately its been making me so self conscious and my eating has been getting bad bcuz of it,1,61

57 days 3 hours and 46 minutes that is my purge free streak i have not gone this far since 2015 edit yay awards,1,24
unpopular opinion i am fucking tired of ed recovery videos fuck the what i eat in a day recovery videos fuck the rail thin vegans who only eat yogurt bowls and oatmeal talking about how they are a year into recovery and loving it fuck the fear food challenges fuck acting like recovery is all rainbows and sunshine and fuck the idea that getting to a normal weight is all there is to recovery these videos are harmful and damaging no i do not want to see the 4 cherry tomatoes with lettuce that you had for your entire lunch i do not care to watch you make eat safe food after safe food and call it fucking recovery i do not want to see your fucking before picture that is essentially thinspo so thanks for triggering everyone my recovery was so difficult and it is a conscious state of mind everyday i am currently relapsing after months of feeling terrible about the weight i gained in recovery and it feels like trying to find ed recovery content is even more triggering than straight up pro ana stuff people who have been through an ed and are supposedly recovered should fucking know better than to flash pictures of their low weights and document everything they are eating end of rant please do not hate in the comments this is just my opinion,1,232
having a baby while you have an ed is selfish now i know this might be controversial and i know that eating disorders are not something you choose to have but i really want to discuss it anyway today during group therapy a girl who is really severely underweight and still very much actively disordered told us she is having a baby she is so happy because she and her partner have been trying for a long time and even though i am happy for her i cannot help myself to also be furious my mom also had an eating disorder while she gave birth to me and she fully recovered when i was about 2 years old i know this had a great impact on the way i look at food now knowing someone is actively trying to have a baby while being so heavily disordered is so selfish to me it is not realistic to say she will be recovered in 9 months either so you just know this baby will be confronted with eating disordered behaviour in the first developing stages of their life even small disordered things will impact a newborn she is very young so saying it is now or never is not an excuse once again this might press the wrong buttons for some people and i am genuinely sorry if i am hurting anyone with this post but i really wanted to speak my mind as i could not tell anyone there obviously,1,250

good morning to everyone except people who say you are not skinny enough to have an eating disorder fuck them but i hope you all have a lovely or had a lovely day if it is not morning where you are,1,41
i am so fucking tired of the strong not skinny thing on instagram like jesus christ just admit that you still have an eating disorder the only difference is that you also have an exercise addiction do not pretend like you are recovered when your entire feed is before after pictures and your idea of body positivity is squeezing yourself into a position so your skin folds a little,1,69
birthday at work did not get judged got an apple nice old guy at work brought in tonnes of cakes for his birthday and came and told me and i said i cannot have cake he did not ask why he asked what i can have cheese fruit biscuits and he went and bought me an apple i have never been so happy and accepted it is usually but why are you on a weird diet or something when i said i cannot have cake i had that big stone in stomach guilty feeling for wasting his birthday cake but his response tool that straight away and when he actually came back with an apple i could have hugged him it felt so nice thanks for coming to my ed talk,1,131

recover for curves some of us will genetically never have a fat ass and tits some of us developed eating disorders due to sexual abuse and do not want a body type that people sexualise some of us are afab but do not identify with femininity recovery is not about looking sexy it is about not being sick i know this has been said before but it really pisses me off i had to learn to recover for a functional body that can do things that make me happy knowing that i would never be thicc  people mean well when they say this shit but it is just not helpful,1,110
found out this afternoon that my mum killed herself i did not talk to her like i usually do on sunday because i was wrapped up in my fucking relapse and too mentally drained from restricting to speak to her yup that is it edit i am overwhelmed in a good way by the amount of love and support i have been shown here i wish i had it in me to reply and thank you all individually which i hope i will in the coming days last night when i found myself unable to sleep and those questions about what would have happened if i would spoken to her or been more available took up all the space in my mind i read through these replies and they were profoundly comforting i am so sorry that so many of you have experienced similar circumstances this is awful and i wish none of you ever had to go through anything like this i love you all thank you,1,168

eating disorders suck but i would rather cry while being skinny than cry for being fat i am so sorry for thinking like this but for me it is the truth,1,31
there is something very refreshing about not knowing what any of you look like it is just interesting knowing all the things we have in common and with appearance being such a major factor with this bullshit it is kind of weird but ultimately helpful and rewarding that all i know about most of you is whatever personality comes through in a comment i think what makes it powerful is that if i try to imagine what any of you look like based on limited information it is basically impossible like when i think of skinny i have no idea if my perception is what you think of or what overweight means to you especially without numbers it is so vague and i like that because it kind of forces me to acknowledge how unreliable it is i cannot know what any of you look like and that is because you really could look like anything really highlights the mental nature of these disorders,1,164
i cannot wait to get skinny so i will feel more comfortable hoeing again that is it that is the post i used to be tiny and got soooo much attention and men worshipped me and ohh my god i miss it goals,1,43
i saw a girl in the food court today and i nearly cried because it reminds me so much of me she sat there with her phone her mom got food for her i was eating the exact same thing and because it is the covid season everybody wears mask unless they are eating mom brought her food left it on her side and proceeds to go buy her own food she stirred and mixed the food around never once taking her mask off to consume the food mom comes back with her own food started eating her own food i was just observing observing if she will remove her mask to finally eat the food mask never came off while her mom picks on her daughter s food from the duration that they were there her mask never came off except for when mom brought her plain 0 calories water mask came off for 10 seconds quickly put mask back on she does not have that typical ed look we all know that means skinny to a point of exhaustion but looking at her face i knew she was sick i nearly cried i was there i was her not too long my mom had to buy me my food my mom had to mix them for me beg me to have a mouth mom had to eat my food there was a girl looking and staring at me weirdly judging me probably while my mom ate my food while she begs me to eat and today i became the girl looking and watching i never went up to the girl because i was overwhelmed with feelings feelings like being so fucking sorry to my mom for doing that to her now that i saw her it felt like seeing myself i hope i was subtle enough with my watching but i just wish she knew that i was not judging her at all that it gets better that i want to give her a tight hug and tell her everything will be better soon it would be tough but it will go over and she will start enjoying food again i am so so sorry that this happening to you so fuckibg sorry,1,375
i am going to be leaving this sub i am going to commit to full recovery now for this reason i will be leaving this subreddit anorexia has taken so much from me and i am ready now to take the plunge i am scared but i am going to do this i am going to do this and get better thank you all for being the supportive home while i was in the thick of my eating disorder but it is now time for me to say goodbye i love you all i wish you all the best and i hope that all of you guys find happiness and health thank you for all your love and support,1,119
i have decided my sole purpose in life is to be thin and fuckable sounds depressing but i am not even mad about it,1,24
taking pleasure in someone else gaining weight i do not know if this is typically for people with ed s but basically my older sister has always been the skinny gorgeous one and i was the opposite i have lost so much weight in the past few years and she gained a ton she moved back in with us and now she is wearing all of my old clothes from when i was overweight and i feel really guilty for being happy about it i have even been baking more because her going through five muffins knowing i am eating none of those calories makes me so happy which i realize is kind of sick but i cannot stop edit to clarify because some people misunderstood i have always baked for the family but growing up she tormented me for eating one serving of something that i baked i know that it is bad that i feel good when she has more than that now and i am not trying to encourage unhealthy behaviors or trigger disordered eating because as mean as she has been i would never want her to feel that way,1,194
black girls and eating disorders ok let us talk so does any other black girls or women feel the need to be small because of angry black woman stereotypes i was just reading a quote from sharpova the woman serena williams beat god knows how many times memoir and she kept harping on how she was so thin and skinny an serena was big and scary in my head i am like ok see this is why i do not want to be big being bigger means anyone can say i am scary anyone will believe someone when they say i have hurt them and no one will believe me if i say someone is hurt or intimidated me because who is going to hurt this night girly black girl mind you i am only 5 feet but i do not think it matters to people like that if you all want the link to the article in reading just ask and i will reply with the link and if the shoe does not fit for you and you have never demonized a black girl for her size but you feel the need to defend yourself in the comments ask yourself why you feel offended by something that does not apply let us be nice we are all suffering,1,219
i just hate it when i save calories specifically for some treat and it ends up tasting disappointing like when i am restricting i can only think about how fcking delicious i remember it to be and how i cannot wait to have just a taste and i starve amp starve amp starve just to make room for that one lil special treat and then when i actually eat it it is like not half as good as i remembered imagined feels like i overpaid for and it hurts my calorie budget laughing out loud double pain if it is also some expensive shit and it hurts my real budget too,1,111

here is a reminder that you did not choose to have an eating disorder i am sure most of you have seen a thread earlier today about giving ourselves an ed by downloading apps looking at pro ana blogs searching thinspo thinking i want to have anorexic or maybe if i develop an ed i will lose weight and i get it it is heartbreaking how many of us gone through this i have i know that is the way we tend to see it that we intentionally sought this out but did we in my opinion no we did not because normal neurotypical people do not sit and think yeah i am going to get an eating disorder today they do not stumble upon pro ana blogs and think wish i could be like that they find it sad and strange you have a predisposition in the first place eds are more than a way of eating and a body type to worship it is trauma psychology socialization body image so much more than downloading tumblr and deciding to fast if you think you are less valid or that you are a wannarexic that you gave yourself this disorder just know that you are not a fake your struggle is real it is not your fault,1,217
does anyone else just   not exercise i always see everyone talk about how much they exercise all the time but i am terrified of being seen i cannot take walks alone because i freak out that everyone is looking at me judging about why i am walking alone i know no one is but my brain is stupid and even exercising in my room alone makes me cry i tried to do a fucking 10 minute dance youtube video and i broke down in tears not halfway through i cannot stop thinking about how stupid i look how my sister would laugh at me how my mother would condescendingly say good for you how id cry even more i just feel so stupid and fake i feel like i am making excuses for myself and i am lazy,1,138
god forbid a skinny person mentions the fact they are bloated i find anytime i mention the fact i am feeling bloated uncomfortable i get met with oh shut up you are so skinny oh stop will ya stop being so silly you look fine and so on etc skinny people get bloated if not more than heavier people and maybe its because i have spent the last 3 weeks heavily restricting have not pooped in 6 days and went on a full on binge yesterday i am bloated i look bloated i feel bloated and i am allowed to comment on it without being met with people thinking i am complaining about being fat they are 2 very different things,1,121
honestly the worst part of having an ed and compulsively checking the scale every morning is having to strip down even though i am literally freezing to death right now this post is brought to you in part from my bathroom,1,41

i get sooo much more attention from men after loosing weight eventhough men like curvy girls    riiight men like to say shit like men like curves    to be honest i call bs on it from my own experience laugh my ass off i used to be on the higher end of a normal bmi i was not super big i had a small frame a big bust a big booty and an at least proportionally small waist all that shit men like to claim men want instead of those skinny girls over 20 pounds lighter and at the bottom of a normal bmi here i am and the weather just started getting better so i broke out the first skirts again with those skinny girl legs and the attention is fucking insane multiple conventionally attractive men trying to get with me in a respectful manner just within the last couple days when i was out i never got that much attention when i was curvy and thicc the attention i got was mostly dumb catcalls but when you get skinnier all of a sudden high profile looking guys are all over you the kind that seem nice and would probably express their sympathy for those poor young girls growing up with those beauty standards and say they totally support body positivity or what not nothing wrong with liking what you like but please at least be honest about it at least my boyfriend is consistent with it complimenting my body less now that i lost weight laugh my ass off,1,260

i swear to god according to the internet there is not a single fucking safe food everything you can possibly eat will fuck with you somehow oh do not eat processed sugar because its high in calories and unhealthy also do not eat too much meat because that is not good for you either plus the fat in them too many calories and cut out any bread and pastries because do not you know carbs are the devil but also do not eat these 300 kinds of veggies like broccoli or onions or beans or cabbage because they are known to because bloating and fruits are cute but that sugar in them absolutely not also no salt because that is going to blow you up like a balloon too but also eat a balanced diet of everything because you need vitamins and minerals lt 333 fuck me i guess i will eat air,1,153
i want to be skinni for such fucked up attention seeking reasons my ed got really bad when my mum had terminal cancer and was in hospice care i weighed my lw the morning of her funeral and damn i looked so good loads of my family had not seen me during her illness and last remembered me at a bmi of 25 then suddenly saw me underweight everyone was so worried during the funeral my weight got mentioned 7 times to my face i was so depressed and ate my way back up to a normal weight my mum died months ago now and people are expecting me to be dealing with it and moving on but i am not the pain is still there just as bad as before my ed brain keeps telling me that if i got down to my lw again or lower people would see that i am not okay i am still struggling it is so attention seeking to want to lose weight so my body screams look at me and worry remember how my mum died i am still fucked up about that pay me attention please,1,195
you have not known true insanity until you have spoken to someone with an ed we be like i am sorry i cannot eat this sandwich because it was cut in triangles which i once read take less time to eat than squares and i need to take the most possible time to eat my food so i will eat less oh uh ok can i make you a new sandwich in squares this time no this is a sign for the universe that i should not eat,1,88
i decided to recover because my new cat could not sit comfortably on my lap i just adopted a new cat and she is the sweetest most friendly adorable little princess out there and despite it being only hours of knowing her she has already changed my life she tried to sit on my lap but she could not get comfortable because of how shirty and shaky my legs are and i felt so horrible all of a sudden i wanted a lap where my cat could sit comfortably i feel like this is kind of a dumb and inane reason but i really wanted to share it,1,108
a warning from yes girl with covid 19 like a lot of the seattlite members of the sub i went from ambivalent about the i hope i catch coronavirus jokes to bristling at them when things started to get really scary here in spite of showing extreme caution minimizing outings sanitizing my phone regularly washing my hands keeping outside clothes off my furniture etc i have covid 19 you all this shit is not fun it is not something mild like a norovirus type stomach flu where your body ejects food from both ends and you lose weight from an involuntary fast i know this disorder puts macabre ideas in our heads where something like that sounds helpful at least in the abstract but that is not what this is i have a mild case by all accounts and even so i cannot recall the last time i felt this horrible for context last year i underwent chemo for breast cancer this is worse my head is killing me everything hurts all over the fever left me sweating through my bedding my chest is heavy like the time i had bacterial pneumonia for a month and just walking from my bed to the kitchen for a drink leaves me faint please please be careful you guys i am lucky in that my son is a teen who is eager to take care of me so i can stay in bed but i know that is a privilege that some people do not have take every possible precaution to limit exposure so that if you do come into contact you have a low initial viral load and your body can begin fighting before it is overcome prepare in whatever ways you can for if when you do get sick have cold medicine inhalers whatever you like to eat and drink when you are feeling bad on hand if you live alone make a group chat with friends or family so you can keep people in the loop easily if you begin showing symptoms look into who you would need to contact for evaluation and or diagnosis if you became ill just please please take this seriously it is not just the flu and even if you are young and healthy it can seriously fuck you up even in a mild case,1,390

does anyone else scroll through restaurant menus online and fantasize about the entire experience of ordering and eating there it sounds so weird putting it in words but sometimes i will go on the website of a restaurant i wish i could eat at and i will look at the calories of a main dish and imagine eating only half of it with a small side or soup from the menu to make sure i am staying under my calorie limit even though i am not actually going there to eat it i imagine getting a sandwich or pasta and immediately throwing half of it away so i am not tempted to eat the whole thing i think about ways i can modify a dish or drink to make it fit my budget and double checking that they got my order right i imagine the taste and texture of the food and the feeling of fullness in my stomach then i snap back to reality and realize how crazy i actually am it is kind of like a virtual dining experience yknow,1,182
a nurse asked me if i ate breakfast or lunch and when i said no she congratulated me being told you are so thin you put the rest of us to shame by a medical professional when you are 30lbs underweight is not exactly reassuring,1,45
does anyone else get reeeaalll mad when you are trying to eat and all of a sudden people will not leave you the fuck alone all i ask for is to be able to eat in peace so that i can focus on my food without any distractions and not have my parents or what have you decide that it is the perfect time to start talking my ears off i just want to enjoy my food but nope cannot even have that fucking much because then when they do not leave me alone and do not fucking shut up and start nagging me about every single fucking thing known to mankind i start lowkey stress eating it and not savouring what i am eating and now i am angry and feel like a fat fuck because i am not fucking satisfied with what i ate i am sorry for the absolute mess of a rant that was but oh my god just leave me alone to eat my damn yogurt nag me when i am finished,1,177

skinny cool girl long time lurker recently becoming active i love each and every one of you to pieces this sub and the love from all of you posting and responding to each other has kept me on track to recovery better than my therapist i am still newly in recovery i think but this has been my longest healthiest about 36 days now compared to 3 5 day binge cycles my whole life i wanted to share what i think of as my secret to success just in case it works on a single other person the goal is to focus compmetely on becoming my alter ego skinny cool girl scg is basically my imaginary role model who is me from the future and is essentially me except she is super hot and climbs mountains and is friendly and adventurous and has lots of tattoos and dogs and is buddhist i was not doing so well on the hot part body dysmorphia or not i am still not sure but damn it i want to be scg so i decided to   start something else scg does besides look good to start rock climbing to get my first tattoo to start hiking to try a kickboxing class to go out with friends i just went skinny dipping no pun intended my next step is to go dancing for the first time i am planning a backpacking trip for next summer i am going to class so i can get the degree scg has scg does not like everything she tries but she tries anything and she does not wait for other people to suggest things she thinks of things she wants to do and seeks them out basically i do not want to do those things but scg does and i want to be scg so i go and i have had a great time and maybe i am getting a little bit closer to being her what i am saying is who will you be when you are your skinny cool girl will you go skydiving will you sing karaoke will you dress in bright bold clothes will you flirt with someone will you eat balanced meals or apply for a better job will you perform or display your art will you go to bed on time what leap will you take someday in order to become her when will she do insert activity here for the first time can you make it happen now take one of the things future scg has about her that you do not have that is not weight related and go do it in the body you own and operate at this moment the brain your soul who you want to be does not change after you lose weight go be her you have to become her still weight is only a small part of the equation you will catch up to scg do not waste time while you think you are fat not being cool girl or else you will lose the weight and find out that scg does not exist yet,1,520

i hate that some people do not realize that a lot of people with eating disorders actually like food i love food man i love the taste and i love eating and i love cooking i love eating out and going out with friends and i used to look forward to meals because i actually do like food this disorder does not change that it just makes me hate myself for loving food and for eating i do not hate food i just hate what i feel like after i eat,1,91
the best call with a girl from school there is this girl who i have never been super close to but she is really sweet and thoughtful so she started bringing me food when she realized that i do not bring any in myself so she called me tonight and asked if i would eat cookies and a banana tomorrow and if she should put it on my desk before people see in case i am self conscious i explained that it is mostly a disordered eating thing where i want to prevent myself from eating so i do not bring any food but i still really appreciate it she said she understood and we talked for almost an hour with her just giving me low calorie indian recipes and telling me how to make them where to get the food before we hung up she said do not think about calories you do not have to look in the mirror get sleep and take deep breaths if you cannot sleep i will have food for you tomorrow and you will eat it if you can i love you and you are beautiful you all i honestly feel so amazing and understood right now i just had to share i had no idea what to say the whole time except thank you and trying to tell her the same in return anyways i am feeling great right now even though i went significantly over my bmr today update she cut a small slice in an orange she brought so it would stay good all day and i did not need a knife to cut it you all she is an angel,1,281

can i be honest may be a super unpopular opinion i might get a lot of hate for this but i miss proed spaces i miss having a space to talk about it and talk about what i ate see what others ate without acting all secretive about it like this sub here people still talk about what they ate and often will mention the meager amount of calories it was or go in depth about their 6k calorie binges the only difference is here you have to pretend that you hate restriction and losing weight again after recovery every post about relapsing or shitposts along the lines of when you tell your friend to eat healthy and you go home and eat 4 strawberries and sleep for dinner there is so many comments like omg same we are so messed up lol there are hardly real recovery posts here it is basically a place to get validation for your binges being okay or your restricting being so awful when the posts are lowkey flexes this sub poses as a place to get help for recovery and share thoughts with other people in recovery but it is just    not really that people post things like i stay away from this sub when i am not restricting so i do not feel bad why would you feel bad about recovering in a recovery sub maybe because that is not what it is it is just a proed sub except anytime you say anything remotely proed you get fuckin swarmed and told you are a shitty person by other people who probably agree with what you said nobody should put other people down for their body types and nobody should tell people that their binges are disgusting or share thinspo images but talking about it aloud to yourself is your choice people say proed things here all the time they just pretend they hate thinking that way when they clearly do not like all the posts comments like i just ate 8000 calories in one sitting so i know my stupid brain is going to make me fast for a week so i can be a skinny sickly little fairy ahaha i hate it ahaha cmon i miss having a sub where you could just admit that and stop pretending you do not visit this sub to be simultaneously triggered and related to,1,401

to the person in their 20s looking at skinny teenagers on tik tok delete the application now remember how much it sucked being a teenager and that the perfect looking girl getting validated in the comments is probably struggling with her own issues and those are rarely shared on social media the sexualisation of young people is a serious problem and by internalizing the narrative that they are more attractive than you will ever be or were we are losing voices to counter this problematic development that is growing more and more dominant in our current society we all had to go through a moment in our young adulthood in which we had to come to terms with the fact that there are people out there that view us as sexual objects at the time our risk reward systems were so fucked up by cognitive developments and hormones that we may not have realised the dangers those people could pose we have all found ourselves in terrible situations because of that i bet now imagine that during that confusing time you were showing yourself off for thousands of people to see and to hear thousands of opinions about the way you look and dress that must be so very mentally exhausting and addicting in a way for some of these young girls this behaviour is not coming from a centered place so have compassion for them rather than resenting them for their desirability forgive yourself for thinking these thoughts just because you are an adult does not mean you will always find yourself doing what is good for you a good start would be to stop engaging with this content and triggering yourself you do not have to infantilize yourself to be attractive you do not even owe being attractive to anyone i know it is hard to want better for yourself it s why you use obsessions with food and aesthetic to cope anyway but maybe take this small step and see where it takes you i promise you will feel better when you delete tiktok amp  x200b edit thanks for the silver lt 3 edit 2 thank you for the wholesome award lt 3 edit 3 thanks for the helpful and heartwarming award i am glad this post resonated with you guys edit 4 thank you so much for the platinum i am glad i could make you feel better anonymous i hope you are doing good it is really sweet lt 3 i have never gotten so much traffic on a post before so this feels really special it feels so weird having people spend money on these badges haha go buy a nice coke zero instead guys edit 5 thank you for the hugz reward lt 3 edit 6 thank you for another hugz award lt 3 edit 7 thank you for the rocketlike andf wholesome awards lt 3,1,483

parents covered mirrors for me ok so basically i am in recovery but it has been really difficult lately so i have been bp for weeks now last night though i could not get anything out since i binged on cashews and i was really bloated because of it i felt so much guilt and could not look at my body because i was so disappointed my parents later came home and asked if i have showered yet i was going to before i bp and i said no and when they asked why i explained to them that i could not do it because of the mirror they do not know i have an ed or am i am recovery but they know about my body image issues i felt so stupid that i went to my room and cried and after 15 minutes told myself i have to just suck it up and went to the bathroom when i opened the door though there was a yoga mat covering the mirror at first i was like oh they are drying the mat for some reason but then it clicked in my head and i was like wait my parents literally went out of their way to cover up the frickin mirror to make sure i was ok like my heart like the fact they did that just made me so happy i want to beat this disorder just for them now gt,1,244

can someone please just fucking deplatform eugenia cooney already this is just my opinion and i get it is probably an unpopular one obviously i do not know her personally so all of this is just my own opinions i wish her nothing but health and happiness but i wish people would stop treating her like she is this sweet girl who can do no wrong she deliberately posts images of herself akin to thinspo ignores the thousands of triggered people in her comments and has built an entire career upon her disorder this is an adult an adult who has suffered with this hell and still fails to give a fuck about the people she is influencing there are young kids in her comments idolizing her body and emaciation it makes me so fucking sick it would be one thing if she was just an influencer struggling with anorexia but it is an entirely different thing to actively profit off of what is essentially thinspo obviously i feel horrible for her that she suffers from this illness and that the people in her life seem like such terrible enablers but it makes me so goddamn angry that she refuses to take responsibility for anything and just hides under this label of nice in my opinion she is a very manipulative person and on some level has an awareness of how she is influencing her audience and ik people are just going to tell me to block her and shit but i am at a point where i do not feel triggered by her but i feel sick by the amount of people in her comments so obviously feeding off of what she posts it just goes back to the romanticization of eating disorders that has led so many people into this hell of an illness and it just pisses me off i do not get how people can drag others down with them ed have a metric fuckton of terrible symptoms but actively fueling the struggle of so many people is not an ed symptom it is a symptom of being a shit person,1,355

fuck you for using me to virtue signal a clearly overweight woman saw my food diary after a date with my boyfriend it was 1114 calories worth of junk food but that was my only meal of the day i usually eat a lot healthier but i just wanted to have a nice movie evening with the man i love she then proceeds to go on about how she cannot even bring herself to eat 1200 calories a day and is often 700 calories under that and that she should eat more like i do so she can get those calories in as fatphobic as this sounds seeing a borderline obese person virtue signal on my amount of food and being completely extra about how much i am apparently stuffing myself with compared to her made me actually want to kill myself edit just for some clarification on why i specifically latched onto her weight i am pasting a reply here that i made on another comment i mentioned it in another reply but i think it may have been super clumsily worded and therefore my meaning did not come across i feel bad but her weight is part of the reason i was so badly triggered i felt overly gluttonous and therefore experienced absolute sickining guilt over how much i had eaten because if someone with a significantly higher tdee than myself only needs 400 500 calories a day as postulated then what the fuck was i doing eating over 1000 why did i need so much food to sustain my smaller body if a bigger body can do with so much less i basically managed to gaslight myself into believing i have reverse body dysmorphia because if she eats so little compared to me how much do i actually weigh it just sent me into a tailspin i am not saying it makes sense but does mental illness ever make sense,1,323
seen a lot of terrible boyfriend posts in here lately just wanted to share about my husband quick background i was in toxic relationship before i met my husband and i wish someone had shaken me and told me that it was not normal and that it was not worth trying to build a lasting relationship with a guy who acted so casually cruel and did not make an effort to care about my well being i have been with my husband for ten years and we have been married for six i have struggled with periods of binge eating and periods of extreme restriction for more than half of my life now while i have been with my husband my bmi s been underweight normal overweight and even obese he is seen it all  most more than once my husband has never said anything negative about my appearance ever not even once not even when i have asked not even when i intentionally make my curly hair super messy and wild to ask him what he thinks as a joke he will say he loves my crazy hair or that it is cute he has said the same positive things about how he finds me sexy when i have been at my fattest and when i have been at my skinniest if he has a secret preference he will never ever reveal it believe me at my lowest i have tried to trick him into admitting it after years of consistent compliments and no negativity i actually trust that he does not care about my weight i never once had to tell him not to comment on my weight he just would not do that because he is a good man we have talked about my ed and how he can intervene when he is worried about me without me feeling attacked or out of control he would known about my issues but when he wanted to learn ways he could help he chose to bring it up at a relaxed time that was good for both of us away from mealtimes  not in the middle of a fight about why i would not eat soup or something now when he notices i am restricting he will ask what he can make me that i will eat  and he will bring it no questions asked so many lovingly prepared salted tomatoes you guys when he notices i have been binging he will start asking if we can do things that will give me an endorphin hit that are not food related plan a trip go for walks on the beach together play with our pets have sex etc he does not comment judgmentally on my eating no wow that is a lot or i made you all of this and you are only having one stuffed pepper from him one time i was on antibiotics and had to eat three meals a day when i sat down for lunch on a day i would also had breakfast he commented oh you are eating a lot today and immediately corrected with i am so sorry i should not have said it like that i meant that it is nice to see you eat three meals a day i get to spend more time cooking and eating with you that is literally the only time this man made any slightly critical comment about my eating in ten years and i did not have to explain to him why it might be triggering when i see you guys posting about men who are at best careless or at worst cruel it breaks my heart i have been there i thought it was what i deserved or that he was just being honest or that i could finally figure out the magic way to explain to him why i was worth being kind to in a way that stuck i did not know that it could be so much better you all deserve so much better,1,673

anyone else go through phases of fuck it for months like i lost a bunch of weight and so i told myself now it is okay to eat some cheat foods in moderation but the second i eat it my brain does the whole body image is a social construct life s too short to not eat just eat everything you want and so on and then i will eat pure junk food for a month and then suddenly the guilt will set in and i will go back to restricting like it is not a binge because it is spread out over a day so i do not even get the discomfort like i can eat so much and i did this every day for a month i wish i didjt jump between extremes lmaoooo,1,136
bless the barista at my local coffee shop my local coffee shop has absolutely no nutritional info on their menu but i love their coffee so much that i have been just winging it with guesses and estimating the calories in the latte i usually get sugar free raspberry mocha it is to die for i messaged the page for them and after a few days of silence one of the baristas that helps manage it finally got back to me went in for their shift and took pictures of the nutritional info for all of their syrups and milks used there to send to me while also providing exact measurements they use in each size of their drinks turns out i have been heavily overestimating the calories all this time oops but i just wanted to rave because i know they did not actually have to do that for me if they did not want to and took the personal liberty of doing so to help out an anxious worm like me because they are just a barista at a smaller local business my mind can finally rest,1,189

i see a lot of repetitive posts in this sub and i just need to say something about it i honestly do not mind one single bit for many people this sub is the only place they have to turn to for anything ed related it is the only support or community they have for help and questions and yes we can argue people should look for posts before they post their own post to avoid repetitive posts but honestly i do not mind at all often we are not in the right frame of mind to look through posts we are freaking out and need quick reassurance an answer or to vent right now if people are restricting sometimes the concentration needed to read through prior posts just is not there let people freak out about weight gain even if we all know it is water weight let people ask if others fee invalid most of us just want quick connection and validation just somewhere where we can give a voice to the ed part of us that needs help so i just love every post and every post is valid except trolls of course in my opinion ask away rant away post away p s sorry for the clickbait title laugh my ass off,1,216
growing up ugly validates our ed one of my 20f guy friends was having a hard time today the dude is like 6 2 incredibly handsome works out studies engineering amazing teeth and energy but still struggles with self esteem bad anyways i am always blown away when he says something about feeling ugly because i tell no jokes when i say this man is a solid 9 5 10 by universal standards i was listing off all the attractive qualities about him in an attempt to make him feel better like that ever works with anybody and he finally breaks tells me he grew up really chubby and got thin in the beginning by severely restricting food even after losing the weight and seeing how people treated him differently he could not shake the vision of himself he formed as a kid fat ugly unloveable if anything glowing up made him more insecure i understood exactly what he meant i grew up with cystic acne chubby awkward i had no friends nobody took me seriously nobody saw me cue my junior year of high school an eating disorder platinum dyed hair and accutane and suddenly the world is full of generosity kindness respect and attention i saw the stereotypical mold of beauty and shoved myself into it no matter the cost on my physical and mental health and it proved 100 of my fears about people treating me badly because i was ugly my friend and i both agreed that glowing up did not make us any more confident in fact it made us more paranoid and kind of justified our bad ed behavior we know what it is like to be ugly and we know how much better life treats you when you are thin and pretty we will do anything not to go back and we are constantly terrified that we somehow transformed back into what we once thought we were without realizing it that we are fat again we know it happened once and know that it could happen again both of us know that in reality our version of fat is probably closer to healthy and do not judge anyone else but ourselves based on these impossible standards can anyone else relate edit typo and thanks for the gold friend lt 3 edit 2 wow thank you all so much for sharing your stories and being so supportive my friend and i have been reading through all the comments as they come and we both agree that is it is been so awesome and validating to see how many of us went through similar situations this community is amazing,1,444

kids should not know what calories are period i love those kids try videos on youtube i was watching the y2k one and one of the questions they asked the little girl probably like 6 or 7 was about sunnyd what do you think the difference between this and orange juice is she responded with more sugar and more calories my dad likes to stay away from things with too many calories or something close to that edit to be clear the question was not what bugged me i was expecting her to say something like i do not think it is made from oranges my heart broke parents need to stfu about this shit your baby does not need to be associating calories with with things that need to be avoided fire should be avoided poison should be avoided running into the street should be avoided calories are literally essential for survival and your child should not be influenced by the belief that fewer is better when they are still growing i cannot even right now edit ohhhh boy i was not expecting to return to this instead of rifling through the individual responses i want to clarify a few things in general i made a major mistake with the title of this post i did not even really think about it honestly and posted it when i was grumpy it straight up says something that i did not really mean which is that kids should not know what calories are as if it is that simple what i actually meant was that young like before eight give or take do not benefit from placing numeric value on items of sustenance everyone is entitled to their opinions on this of course but my opinion is that placing that value has harmful implications versus say explaining that a calorie is a unit of energy to fuel our bodies which was mentioned and i am on board with furthermore for a parent to impart onto a child that fewer calories good is ridiculous an apple may have more calories than a cracker but we can all agree which has more nutritional value young children again young do not necessarily have the context yet to deduce that on their own i would never suggest hiding the fact that calories exist if a child was to ask about them it is like a kid asking where babies come from right if your five year old asks you you are probably going to give them age appropriate honest answer but you are probably not going to sit that five year old down to give them the birds and the bees chat unsolicited proper education is good you all of course this is a complex and controversial subject and i so so appreciate all of you who have shared your opinions and experiences there is no catch all correct way to handle something like this for every kid and all of us here have especially passionate opinions on this subject in particular the best i can hope for is that future generations have better relationships with this thing that is required for survival read food than i do the above is still not perfect clarification but i hope it better explains what my intentions were in posting this this is a community of beautiful thoughtful fiercely intelligent individuals and i feel really fortunate to have all of you here,1,574

does anyone else find it easier to not eat all day than try to restrict certain foods i feel like it is so much easier to not eat at all than it is to follow a certain diet plan or plan my meals in advance because i end up with intense cravings and cannot stop myself from eating junk food also when i take that first bite of food my progress feels ruined instantly and i feel like i look fat already,1,82

i almost died from omitting drug information throwaway because my friends and my gf have reddit and i am cross posting this on tifu as well this is something that i have never had to think about until today thursday afternoon i started having extreme angina chest pain it radiated up to my shoulder and i could not stop sweating i immediately called the ems because my girlfriend was freaking the f out and was in no condition to take me to the er she gets panic attacks over medical stuff and i was starting to have trouble breathing here is the part where i fucked up one of the paramedics was asking me questions about medical history and medications i was on he then asked about ed medications i had taken about 50 milligram the day before but i did not want my girlfriend to know about it because i had not had time to talk to her about it yet and i was embarrassed big mistake they gave me nitroglycerin which is a vasodilator turns out viagra is a vasodilator as well my pressure bottomed out and i almost died i could have ended my life that day and i would have never seen anyone that i loved ever again because i told a fucking stupid lie i swear it is not worth it to be embarrassed please please always tell medical personnel about your medical history and any drugs you take because not doing so could cost you your life i had to learn this the hard way but please be aware of the side effects of ed medications especially if you have had heart issues they can interact with a lot of different drugs tl dr ed meds are always relevant to medical history do not lie to your gf edit i am so fucking sorry ohhhhh man i meant to post this to an erectile dysfunction sub i forgot to type it out so i just put ed and put it in the first one that came up now the strange flairs make sense i wish you all the best with getting better,1,358

one of the reasons why i think a pro ana forum should be left existing in peace is because at least the toxic bitches will flock there to be toxic to each other and leave people outside of their ed circles alone this thought is inspired by a comment left on a tt of a girl trying to lose weight saying simply fatspo by an user named dietcokefairy no less yes it is that corny i know they are sick and are probably 14 but holy hell is that scummy same with people on edtwt retweeting pics and calling them fatspo like keep it in your group chats and stop poisoning the well ohmygooooood,1,114

does anyone else want to be thin so they look classy growing up i always hear curvy people being called trashy for wearing some piece that people would call a slim person classy for wearing the only difference is the other has more ass or boobs than the other so now i basically equate thinness to sophistication i mean audrey heburn is the poster child for all things classy i have been poor all my life and i always wanted to appear wealthy and i believe looking classy is part of that but my wide hips and fatter butt just make it impossible and it is probably one of the reasons why i developed an eating disorder even then it is not like my body structure s ever going to change i am always going to have wide hips so i will never really look classy which is really frustrating i feel like i am always going to hate myself does anyone else aspire to look classy too also why do you think being slim is seen as classier than being thick i always thought it is because they practice moderation or have really great self control but there is the racism angle too because some non white communities may have different standards like being thicker edit also if you are curvy people would think of you as slutty no matter what you wear but i do not want to look that way i want to be a fucking fairy or something i am sorry for making it seem like i am the only person who figured this out because i truly never had that assumption i should have clarified my question and phrased it another way,1,287

eating disorders are so expensive i am cycled through bed to anorexia and everything in between it does not matter if i am restricting binging binging and purging or attempting some sort of recovery food is expensive restricting let us buy individually wrapped pre portioned baby food at 4 per 15 grams of some sort of puff buy 27 of these 30 a week on diet coke or your preferred poison let us buy this sugar free syrup for 10 use it in all one night because your body thinks it is energy hah pour 5 tbsps of not sugar 15 onto your fancy fat free sugar free yoghurt 10 to make it bearable spend 30 on vegetables that you will either never touch or you will eat it all to full the void without the calories allow yourself to order a gourmet pizza 25 but end up chewing and spitting it drink through a litre of almond milk a day with varying amounts of tea and coffee 3 daily binging hungry jacks drive thru ubereats 40 on chocolate that is gone within the hour replacing other peoples food you ate hoping to god they will not notice re buying that same food because you went on another binge in the process of trying to replace said food purging all of the above minus any minuscule scrap of nutrient also teeth decay a whole other financial crisis recovery safe food sourced from the hidden rivers guarded by an ancient tribe and nurtured and or hand crafted by the village women either that or more baby food all organic of course the look on your housemates face when they find bags full of your chewed up food priceless,1,287
i really hate what keto has done to my community spicy title i know and it is not really keto but diet culture as a whole i am asian and my country s cuisine is entirely based on rice we eat rice every meal we eat rice noodles when we dine out we eat rice desserts we eat various kinds of rice on our lunar new year rice has always been a symbol of warmth and health a humble food that is beloved and cherished even in its plainest state lots of people love eating a steaming bowl of plain white rice maybe with a lil bit of soy sauce or fish sauce on top and in 7th grade i was taught that white rice is why i was fat and i got to stop eating it and now i am terrified of rice i am constantly fantasize of the day i get skinny enough to eat rice keto is getting so popular in my country and i am so scared for little boys and girls hearing about the devil that is white rice hell i am scared for the women and men of all ages hearing bullshit about how it has fuck all nutritions and that is why we got to stop eating it altogether our diets are very balanced 1 cup to 2 of rice per meal with soups poached veggies a meat dish a stir fry pan fried dish keto has no business here and i am targeting keto specifically because it is a bullshit diet that disguised as scientific or some shit it is taking advantage of this carb moral panic that will be out of fashion sooner or later much like fat before debunking keto is getting more popular nowadays but the craze is only getting started in my country watching my mother debating whether watermelon is unhealthy because it has carbs is frustrating and heartbreaking also i miss eating rice sm,1,327
in real life thinspo is the worst seeing any girl in real life who has that thinspo body that would literally be perfect for ed twt tiktok or instagram is so triggering for me in fact it is probably the most triggering thing for me any time i see a girl who looks like this i cannot help but wonder if she has an eating disorder or if she is naturally built like that or if she is the kind of girl who eats to live or forgets to eat and i feel so fat around her even though i am literally bordering underweight myself,1,105

kim k not feeling her hands because of her weight loss i can not express how much this angers me she is one of the most famous persons in the planet and she is a disgraceful human being she knows everyone is watching she loves that and she likes to pretend in her little fantasy world that she is a great role model she is anything but a role model what she is doing is so hurtful to all the young girls and boys out there and i know she knows she just does not care she shared that she had a health scare due to her weight loss and could not feel her hands tf did you expected and to all the people that were defending her saying she lost the weight in a healthy way with pros   yeah you all are fucking clowns we knew that this whole situation is so messed up and it makes me so fucking angry because they see the pretty part about it the glitz the glam the sparkly dress the blond hair the pretty face the praised celebrity what about cracked nails missing hair muscle cramps numbness extreme fatigue headaches the burning stomach the deadly pain the constipation how you are praying just to take a shit feeling so cold all the time the ugly dry gray skin the uti the brain fog kidney failure the depression the loneliness fuck her and everyone who promotes this kind of stuff edit apparently this was caused due to her eating meat again wich caused psoriasic arthritis that being said i still think what she did was not healthy dangerous and should not be something to promote,1,282
does anyone else feel like they cannot hook up with anyone or enjoy sex until they are skinnier i am recently single and i realized something stupid and dumb which is that every time i start flirting with someone and the conversation turns toward sleeping together or hooking up i get too nervous about them seeing my naked body and so i chicken out last week i was literally sitting on a guy s lap kissing him and i told him i did not want to take my shirt off because i am just not ready for sex but in reality i was horny af boi i just did not want him to see my stomach can i get an f to pay respects edit yes know what i am a bisexual bitch and these replies lowkey make me feel affirmed and not alone but also very sad because all of you all are beautiful and if i saw you naked i would get after it on god but obviously it is harder to think those jazzy positive thoughts about ourselves duh,1,182

skinny people who complain about not being able to gain weight they all say they eat a lot and then you watch them and they do not laughing out loud my best friend had a bowl of oatmeal for breakfast today then declined all food offers because she was still stuffed n then has the nerve to complain about being too skinny and how she wants curves god edit i love how many people suggested health issues or a secret ed like that might be the case for other people but my friend literally just does not eat because she is depressed and has no energy to cook or go buy food which is why i made oatmeal for her and she is not the only person i know and can guarantee has no ed but does not eat enough to gain but says they eat a ton lh nm,1,150

so many viewers agree that to the bone does not accurately reflect their experience of eating disorders so why does it have such a hold over us to the bone starring lilly collins as ellen a twenty year old anorexic if you have come across it you will probably know that it is highly popular amongst viewers suffering from eating disorders particularly on ed tumblr it is intended as a story of hope and recovery with a brutally honest depiction of the impact an eating disorder has on somebody and the people around them i would argue that its appeal is so strong because it is an unrealistic interpretation of the lived experience of someone with an eating disorder which shows a standard or ideal that lots of us might aspire towards in our most difficult times ellen is tiny she is also strikingly pretty and she also has perfect control and apparently does not experience hunger at all how is that realistic i do not think i have met anyone yet who does not face a daily battle with cravings internal conflicts obsession with choosing what to eat agonising over what they ate bingeing exercising intensely to get rid of it the whole shebang what do you guys think it is been playing on my mind lately update i am blown away by your responses here guys it is the very first time something i have posted to reddit has set up some good discussions thanku sm,1,248
i literally never eat guys i literally hate girls that use this as a flex to guys like stop you are not impressing anyone you are just making all the other girls feel bad we see you when the men leave asking if we can doordash food for all of us why in the world are you trying to bring us down for a natural need sure talk about how small you are and how you only need a side portion of fries in front of the guys and then go eat the whole kitchen when they leave the eating habits alone are not the problem it is putting me down because i ate a normal healthy meal in front of a man when i have not eaten properly in several days just shut up about what other people eat you are not cool for not eating i feel bad for you and not even in a good way i have a severe eating disorder and you are trying to make it cute it is ok i just smile and giggle throught it,1,183
does anyone else feel like the main character when restricting when on a walk today put on my headphones and started playing some sad ass music i was wearing an all black outfit with pantyhose and dr martens and all i could think about is how dainty i felt and how proud i am knowing how well i am hiding my last relapse and how comforting in a sick way it was to feel emptiness again this whole vibe made me feel like the main character of a movie or book i felt like my ed makes me interesting enough to be worthy of being inspiration to a writer if i smoked i am pretty sure i would have pulled out a cigarette right then and there just feeling like i am supposed to be this major stereotype of a skinny anorexic now this is not at all coming from a sense of narcissism whatsoever like madam i literally hate myself lmao but i have definitely noticed how much more interesting and overall cool i feel when i am deep into my bullshit does anyone else relate edit wow guys this thread got more attention than i thought i am so interested in the fact this seems to be a common theme in ed behaviors and it truly makes me feel less alone also makes my curiosity even bigger   i love you allll,1,233

being honest is great i am back with my parents for a week i was really nervous because my mom likes to make high calorie dinners however last night she was making pasta and pasta is a fear food for me so i literally just told her that little background i was diagnosed with bulimia nervosa several months ago my parents know that if i went to get diagnosed again i would say i have anorexia with a b p subtype anyways i told my mom hey is it ok if i do not have the pasta and instead just have your grilled chicken and a salad pasta is a trigger food because i used to binge and purge on that and she is like yeah oh my god of course you do your thing i also told her that ice cream cereal and cake are also trigger foods and she told me i do not have to eat her carrot cake this week she is making it for my brothers graduation being honest is giving me control and shown me she can be understanding am i a little guilty that i am doing it so i can restrict yeah but i am also not lying about what will trigger a binge purge episode and that feels great,1,218
does anyone else never want anyone to notice know you have lost weight because you are so ashamed and embarrassed that you ever weighed more than you do now like i do not want anyone to ever know i had have weight to lose despite how ridiculous that is because all the people i know have eyes at the same time i also want people to notice and worry about me because i want the attention but only like the exact right amount of worry that it does not actually interfere with my ed but makes me feel validated thank you and that is on l o g i c,1,110

bed rant no one talks about binge culture tl dr binge culture ruined my life and my health and is ruining the lives of my entire community but no one is talking about it binge culture ruined my life i was born and raised in texas and i cannot speak for anywhere else but i know that here and in a lot of the usa southern states bigger is better that means bigger food portions bigger clothing sizes bigger seating bigger drinks everything is catered towards larger sizes i hear about diet culture a lot but down here where i live it really does not exist maybe for certain communities but for the most part people here revel in constantly binge eating foods that are extremely rich sickeningly sweet oily cheese smothered hot amp spicy and eating massive portions of them it is very difficult to find foods that are low in calorie or even any type of specialty food for people with medical conditions or food allergies vegans are openly ridiculed and bullied for not eating meat to the point where even products that are somewhat associated with veganism are openly derided by our state legislators see ted cruz s rant against tofu and soy products which was extremely ironic considering texas is one of the largest producers of soy in the entire usa gluten free products might take up half a shelf at the grocery store while there are literally two full aisles just for sodas when i started at my job they did not have a uniform in my size but they had plenty of l 3xl uniforms i had to size up to a medium and it was the only medium they had left literally everyone i know eats out at restaurants or takeout 3 4 times per week sometimes every single day for lunch and this is accepted as normal people who bring their own lunches in to work are seen as weird even if they cannot afford to eat out with their higher paid colleagues my friends and coworkers are constantly complaining about their health effects caused by being overweight but they do not want to change how what they eat and they laugh and joke about their previous heart attacks or diagnoses of diabetes as if it is no big deal heart disease is the 1 killer in texas even though it is highly preventable the culture has been this way since i was a child this is the culture that gave me an eating disorder not diet culture a binge culture telling me that bigger is better that eating 2 full sized portions meant to feed 2 people can and should be eaten just by me in one sitting and that that is treating myself a capitalist culture telling me to buy and consume as much as possible because that will make me happy a culture blasting advertisements in my eyes and ears everywhere i look telling me this new food product is what is going to make me happy even if it is just for a few minutes a culture that has normalized eating 3 servings of ice cream in one sitting as a way to help you when you are sad a culture that has massive potlucks at church every sunday and has normalized the sensation of eating 3 full plates or more until you are uncomfortably full even to the point of damaging your stomach this is binge culture this is normal in my community and it is devastating it binge culture is just as insidious as diet culture even more so in fact because the binge culture is supported and subsidized by the massive corn industry which is in everything corn syrup corn starch even things like citric acid that is from corn too the 528 billion dollar fast food industry the 200 billion dollar soda industry and the 105 billion dollar chocolate industry which relies heavily on child slavery see nestles 2014 labor report in west africa compare that to the 72 billion dollar diet industry and that is generous and tell me which culture is more influential here in texas the winner is clear the only reason diet culture even exists in the first place is because of these highly influential and powerful food industries that have messed up the way that people are meant to intuitively eat which is not possible in an artificial environment where people are constantly bombarded with food and images of food that are artificially engineered to be hyper palatable visually pleasing unsatiating physically addicting and constantly available wherever you go this is why i developed bed not because of diet culture but because binge culture is so accepted and normalized where i live that it is seen as the norm i know this sub caters more towards restrictive eating disorders but bed is just as valid of a disorder as an and us folks struggling with bed deserve to be heard i struggle with extremely disordered binge eating but i do not feel like i can find support among some of these subs because they often facilitate the binge culture mindset and trigger me into bingeing sentiments like restriction always leads to a binge make my mind say well you might as well just binge and not even try because any form of self control restriction i guess sentiments like if you refuse any food offered to you at all that is restriction and that is a disordered mindset being touted as recovery progress when for me the inability to refuse food is a hallmark of the bed mindset this is not helpful to me and other bed sufferers and is actually enabling my form of eating disorder which is ironic for a sub that claims to be for only pro recovery i just wish i could find the support of like minded people who have suffered the way i have because of the way we were raised,1,998
so sick of professors wanting me to do work when i have an eating disorder to focus on so rude,1,20
does anyone else not count calories but just restricts based on vibes idek how this works for me since my restrictive ed is mainly a control thing but i do not count calories if i see something too high in calories i will not eat it the definition of too high is based on vibes i just eat as little as possible while still being able to semi function at work it makes me feel not valid in my ed but it also gives me no sense of how much i am eating so i cannot tell if i am being too reckless i probably am it makes me feel like i am eating completely normally i am definitely not and do not need to go to treatment i do,1,130
stop telling people with eating disorders to try insert restrictive diet here no going vegan will not cure my anorexia keto will not suddenly make it possible to eat anything without guilt whole30 will not make me start eating a balanced diet we are all still going to restrict fast binge purge on any diet until we are ready to get better we all have enough food rules and restrictions as is stop trying to make us scared of more food because i assure you we are aware probably even more so than most people of what we are putting in our bodies and the risks rewards of foods do not feed me bs that your brother s girlfriend went vegan because you said so and you cured her eating disorder either she was working towards her own recovery mentally because it is a mental illness or she is just hiding it now,1,153

skinny ig models purposefully posing in an unflattering way and saying i like my body anyway fuck off there is a new trend of skinny women posing in order to show their little skin rolls or showing as much fat as possible they contort their bodies so much in order to look as big as possible it almost feels like they are body checking or mocking fat people who look like that without having to contort or wear unflattering clothes that is just their bodies and i hate the idea of having to love yourself despite what you look like it seems like the wrong message to send,1,108

i did the cha cha slide a week ago after it popped into my head and i jokingly calculated how many cals it burned from my fitness watch now i have to do the cha cha slide at least twice a day or i get anxious and everything feels worse this is the sickest joke my brain has played on me yet i can handle the constant intrusive thoughts about food exercise my weight body checking my appearance calories nutrients etc but thinking about when i can do the cha cha slide if i did not get to do it that morning or when i will do it that evening and having the song constantly play in my head is a whole other can of worms,1,126

society claims to be anti ed while normalizing underweight bmi tw most liked praised popular seen as pretty women i see models e celebs etc are underweight either suspected or if you get their stats conformed i am not just bitching about celebrities this extends to people in small online communities or irl for example even less covertly from what i gather in eastern europe and asia where being skinny is openly a pressure the there was even a thread here about how women are treated better when underweight i have seen it too you cannot deny that this is being encouraged this type of lookism is real and when you are critical of why a bmi of 17 is glamourised you are called jealous by random men amp  x200b when normies say they are anti ed they mean they are against the unattractive parts of ed the purging the extreme skeletal look and so on they don t care about health especially yours why should i be discouraged from relapsing now that i am ugly and a normal weight when if i would id be still ugly but get praise for being petite chic from random anti ana normies amp  x200b amp  x200b sorry for the rant and the shit formatting i just wanted to call out the gaslighting i see,1,222

sometimes i wish i was skinny the way guys are skinny i hate that as a woman my body just retains so much fat i know that no matter how much weight i lose i will never think that it is enough i wish i could be like guys my age who eat gt  6k cals  lt a day and instead of gaining they lose i hate that i will always have a womanly body and a wide ribcage and a stomach that will never be flat enough i get so jealous of guys who eat so much and never gain weight and still have the skinniest thighs and stomach i will never have an androgynous body no matter how much i purge and restrict,1,125
pooping after 23 days without i made a throwaway just for this heavy tmi just want to share the unpretty parts of an ed i will use numbers just saying i do not know how to censor it sorry i track my poop routine it helps me worry less about weight gain thankfully the last time i pooped was april 23 i tried every online hack to poop tried a coffee mono for 3 days tried every laxative in the shops near me so how did i poop vitamin c i took about 6000mg and was sitting within the same hour it was excruciatingly painful and i am bleeding but guess what it is over i am normal again thankfully no longer in pain you want to know how much poop was in my guts how horrifically bloated i was 10 kilograms of shit before i literally looked pregnant my stomach was huge i was constantly in pain every time i ate it hurt more i am going to start recovery because of this incident truly a wakeup call i will likely never post here again but i just wanted to share with everyone that eating disorders are horrendous anyone glamourizing it really needs to pull their head out of their ass edit turning off notifications logging out of this account too many notifications i hope this encourages some of you to recover at least laughing out loud,1,238
wanting an eating disorder is a sign of an eating disorder because fuck you i am mad about this i have come across so many people on ed platforms saying you do not want an eating disorder because x and y man no healthy person wants an eating disorder and you saying that an eating disorder is not real and just a fantasy until you are actually in the hospital with a feeding tube is just discouraging people including myself from getting help early into the disorder we should know better than this if you claim that a person just wants an eating disorder to get skinny or to get attention propability is they already have one and you are just not taking them seriously because they are not half dead yet i am mad that is all,1,138

normal diet info was just as bad for me as pro ana content i have found in ed treatment they often ask do you look at online ed content and there is this huge stigma about pro ana stuff for obvious reasons however for me personally keto water fasting if info online was way more harmful with pro ana stuff at least you know it is coming from someone with an ed and i often find it cheesy and cannot take it seriously reading about people who insist that they are not disordered going days without eating or only eating every specific things and avoiding carbs at all costs was super harmful because it felt very invalidating made my problems seem normal this is not to say that pro ana stuff cannot also be harmful i understand it has been very damaging for so many people i just think treatment providers need to realize that you can find ed disordered rhetoric everywhere not just on explicitly pro ana sites,1,169

i tested positive for covid and have lost my taste and smell i thought i would be so happy to not be able to taste or smell anything that i could control myself easier that i would not eat and finally lose the weight but let me tell you this has been the hardest time of my life mentally i cannot believe i have restricted myself over eating all the great foods there is i cannot believe i miss the taste of my fear foods and that i hate myself for purging most of my meals before getting covid i miss the taste of food so fucking bad and i am promising myself once i get to taste again i will go mad and eat everything i want whenever i want without any restrictions or purging i should have considered myself lucky instead of ugly to be able to eat food i should have felt grateful instead of feeling miserable taking every single bite once i get to taste again i will ask my mom to cook me her homemade lasagna and i will eat it all without a thought i will thank my family for inviting me over to dinner instead of getting upset at them i will go grocery shopping without looking at the amount of calories i will look at my body and be proud of its healthiness you never know what can happen to you or your senses so please enjoy it while it lasts do not beat yourself over calories i think not being able to taste or smell will finally break my ed habits hopefully please all take care of yourselves,1,277
turns out really skinny people just do not eat very much an honest observation from being hyper aware from my ed is that i have noticed that my really skinny friends simply do not consume very much because they are actually too busy or they have small portion sizes or they do not finish meals because they are too full or too picky sometimes i know it is because they are also struggling with disordered habits themselves but with a good amount of people i know very well they just are not that big into food my brother s a good example he is been underweight his whole life and it is because he is just never been very interested in food plus he is really lazy so he would not go out of his way to buy or make food growing up he ate his meals and did not care for ice cream or sweets or soda and as an adult he eats full meals and does not snack i mean it is not like i just discovered cico i have known it for years and knowing it fuelled my ed because i became addicted to how true and simple it was as a rule i thought the science was just so amazing like if i did x then y happened wow great easy thanks done but yeah i just find it so interesting to observe it daily in the wild,1,242
let us all be nice to protein bars please i feel like i see so many fitness influencers demonizing protein bars or calling them glorified candy bars and for what even my own father will comment on them and lecture me on how much sugar i am eating it is so annoying because for me and a lot of other people who are suffering protein bars are a staple safe food they are yummy and ease the guilt of eating something like a candy or chocolate with the same flavors although if normal sweets are a safe food for you then that is wonderful and you should enjoy them besides i know a lot of us have low blood sugar from restricting and personally i get next to no protein in my diet so there is absolutely nothing wrong with enjoying something like a protein bar so fitness youtubers please do not come for my groceries they are fine i promise,1,161
mukbangers competitive eaters and the open secret of bulimia let us get a little controversial we have all seen them and probably watched them jealously while fighting off hunger pangs the dainty good looking people who gorge themselves on a buffet s worth of burgers pizzas and every brand of fast food under the sun every other day racking up thousands of views and never gaining a single pound it seems every person with a knowledge of eating disorders knows exactly how these people maintain their trim figures yet a quick scroll through the comments always shows a vast majority of people praising their good metabolism yes metabolism varies from person to person but not so much that you can maintain 110lbs while embarking on regular 20k calorie challenges it feels like purging is pretty much an open secret among many and that people just choose to ignore it because it is inconvenient and ugly and spoils whatever fantasies watching these videos provide,1,163
so i just took a dna test turns out i am 100 fat bitch,1,14
whenever i am restricting i am refreshing this subreddit obsessively what i am looking for no idea but i am sure one day i will find it 2nd day in a row i am posting here but i cannot stress enough how food is on my mind allll the fucking time all the time i have no rest hahaah,1,59
the quirky little food nicknames in those wieiad tiktoks are so infantile and viscerally offputting cinna toasties nugs chickie tendies choccy milk i will vomit,1,25
anti binge trick i read elsewhere for those that go slightly over limit and think well fuck it might as well eat 3k cals now okay so i do not binge often but i saw this and it seemed like something that would really help me if i did i have a calendar and some crayons every day that i stay under my preferred calorie deficit gets colored green if i go over that deficit by 1 199 calories it gets colored yellow if i go over 200 499 my bmr it gets colored orange and if i go over by 500 it gets colored red so days i might go over by a few calories i usually stop at 199 so i can keep the day yellow this is also helpful so i can have a visual of a month of mostly green squares with one or two yellow orange and know i am making an overall big difference and the green yellow orange are all still deficits or maintenance so it is helpful to know i did not derail any work i have made just slowed it by a tiny smidge i know stuff like this will not help everyone but maybe someone would benefit,1,207
we have heard of girl math what is eating disorder math i will start eating crackers out of the bag is a fear food for me but when i measure them out it is no longer a fear food being skinny will solve all of my problems eating a sandwich with individual ingredients that i can measure out totally fine eating a casserole nope i do not know the exact amounts of each thing eating a granola bar scary eating that granola bar throughout the day for different snacks not as scary,1,92
i worry about the girls in the thinspo pics from 5 10 years ago i was thirteen when i started frequenting pro ana spaces online and seeing thinspo when i see the same pictures now i start to worry about the girls in the photos are they okay what are they doing right now have they recovered were they forced into recovery are they even alive the thought that pictures of potentially dead girls are still circulating haunts me imagine having a child die of anorexia and then seeing a picture of them shortly before their death while scrolling through instagram and imagine seeing comments from other girls and young women aspiring to look like your dying child almost as terrifying imagine recovering starting a family making a life for yourself and being happy only to stumble upon a repost of a picture of you dangerously underweight at 16 and calling it perfection i remember thinking back then how mature and grown up those girls looked now nearly a decade later i feel like someone is going to call chris hansen on me when i accidentally stumble upon those pictures they are all so young,1,195
how the fuck do people diet and lose weight without developing an ed i know that if i did not have an on and off ed this would not be a question but how the hell do people restrict and count their calories without developing an unhealthy relationship with food how do you not hate your body while you try to do it amp mentally punish yourself after binging or just going over your calorie limit for the day god i really long for the day where i can be able to achieve this i would honestly consider that one of the main indicators that i have fully recovered,1,109
my friends daughter hugged me i was playing around with her at the cafe tickling her feeding her a little ice cream making her laugh and after i sang a little for her she stood up on the seat beside me warble i wuv you and hugged me i felt overwhelmed and actually lovable it is just nice when a little kid says they love you i have a lot of bad thoughts with my ed telling me i am not wanted unless i am skinny but this kid loves me for having fun with her,1,96
why are dads just horrible to their daughters with eating disorders like he literally told me he knows i struggle with food body image yet goes absolutely out of his way to make demeaning comments towards what i eat how much i eat etc like i could be on my first meal of the day at 5pm and he will hit me with the eating again this is why you cannot lose weight sir fuck you,1,76
lied to by tumblr imagines from 2012 just hit my final goal weight this morning and i did not jump out of bed to try on my size 0 jeans that fit my skinny waist and thigh gap perfectly and then have an awesome day of being skinny instead i woke up in an unnamed non american location which is where i have lived my whole life where they do not sell size 0 clothing having completely lost my voice because of this throat infection and the only thing that fits me perfectly is five thousand scarves and two blankets and staying in bed all day i do not even know what size 0 means,1,115
today i had a conversation with a 65 year old woman who suffered from anorexia for the last 50 years and i cannot think about anything else i work at a clothing store and today i tried helping a woman who comes in often but i have never really talked to her because she always leaves quickly without buying anything this time she tried on some jeans and she looked so freaking sad it was heartbreaking she then told me she is sick of hating herself this much and that she had been suffereing from anorexia since she was about 15 because of her ed she was nt able to have children and she said every partner she ever had left because at some point they simply could not keep watching her destroy herself and she told me how lonely she was her ed destroyed her teeth her digestive system she lost almost all of her hair and because of all her health problems she was nt able to work since her 40s she told me she missed out on everything in life and she never even went on vacation i do not know how this conversation even happened she probably needed someone to talk to but it really hit home i have been struggleing with an ed for almost 10 years now and if i do not change my future will look very similar everytime i think about her i start crying again i feel so sorry for her and i am afraid i have had so many wake up calls and nothing made me change so i do not think this will be any different but i feel like i really need to do something or it will be too late sorry for the little rant,1,298
i ate bread oh my god guys i had toast with eggs for breakfast this morning and i did not self combust i have not had bread in 8 yrs sure it was super fancy overpriced multigrain bread that i spent way too much time examining before buying but i ate it and it tasted good and i was satisfied after this is amazing what a feeling,1,67
spoiler alert actually hitting your gw is miserable when i read the scale a few days ago there was not any moment of joy or celebration i did not get a break from hating myself and my body i just kind of stared at the number confused because i do not see any difference in my body from any other weight i have been and then went to lay down because i am exhausted depressed and disappointed i skipped so many tasty meals to get here and it was for literally nothing and now i cannot stop losing weight and i am terrified my circulation is terrible so my hands and feet are numb constantly i do not have the energy to exercise and ballet used to be my favorite thing to do my hair is thin greasy and stringy my teeth need 30k of work to be normal again i am constantly covered in bruises and dizzy i sure hope this is my low point but we all know how this goes,1,173
why does food always have calories like seriously literally every single time i go grocery shopping the food in the store has calories and so many of them even it is just soooo annoying i want the food i never said i want the calories as well alright can someone do something already am i really just supposed to ingest calories every time i eat what is the matter with this country,1,72
sometimes i feel we need more tough talk in recovery do not get me wrong it is great that we are kind to each other listen to each other s fears and worries and try to be compassionate and understanding a caring supportive environment is always the best to achieve full and sustainable recovery however i also do feel that   i do not know us with eds do not really like to be told certain things we know those to be true but we hate hearing them nonetheless so here is some ideas that i have that usually get me into heated arguments with other people in recovery 1 it is a choice to engage in any kind of behaviour you can say all you want that i cannot help but restricting i cannot stop purging it is beyond my control etc but the harsh reality is that you do have a choice you do choose to engage in those behaviours you can choose not to you did not choose to have an ed but you do choose everyday to keep having one there is no one no one but yourself that forces you to keep restricting purging exercising or whichever other behaviour characterizes your ed and so many people interpret this as it is your fault you just have to do it whereas this is absolutely not the case what i am actually trying to put across is that you do have the control to change your actions and this feels incredibly empowering knowing that you also know what to do next which does not mean you have to do it alone you may very well have to ask for help but it is still up to you 2 your triggers are your problem yes society is shit yes people are often assholes maybe they try to be nice and they fail maybe they do not understand how you feel maybe no one does but as an adult living in the real world you cannot expect anyone to accommodate your issues you probably also say a lot of stupid stuff that might hurt someone else and you do not know anything about it that is life recovery is also learning to be confident enough that you do not have to be bothered by any random comment you read or run back to your ed everytime you feel uncomfortable 3 you have to quit all the excuses you can trick your therapist your dietitian your parents your friends strangers on the internet and everyone else into believing all you want them to believe that you forgot to eat or you just want to walk to manage anxiety or that you are doing everything you can but in the end the only person that loses is you real life does not care about any shenanigans and if you are not fully honest with yourself and the others you will just be wasting time that no one will give you back while the rest of the world goes on without really caring about you that is it thank you for coming to my shitty ted talk,1,524
friendly reminder that the calories do not count if it is your best friend baking you cookies my bff made me peanut butter maple syrup cookies i had panik at first but they do not fucken count i ma enjoy these cookies with every fibre of my being nick i love you so much stay epic,1,56
does anyone else absolutely hate their body and constantly feel terrified of existing in it while feeling a constant urge to starve in order to be skinni but is unable to actually stop themselves from eating normally in addition to binging on every single candy item in the house p a i n,1,53
ya ll ever get reverse body dysmorphia like you see yourself skinnier than you actually are then suddenly the illusion drops and you feel disgusting wondering how you let yourself get to this point that is pretty much what is been happening to me i went away for a week on vacation and ate a lot so when i got back i was afraid to weigh myself i did not make a big deal out of it thinkin i will drop the weight right away and that i still looked the same so i could not have gained that much but today i woke up and my stomatch is insanely bloated and i am extremely aware of the fat on my body touchin against itself i took my dog for a walk today and made the mistake of wearing some super thight leggins and looking at myself in my bathroom mirror rather than the one in my room which i realized today is kind of slanted to i look skinnier on it long story short i am fatter than i thought i was and disgusting and keept letting myself eat normal amounts of food cuz i thought i was still skinny i want to fucking die i have been trying to get skinny since january but i have been extremely lazy i plugged in the numbers into a calculator and i for sure will not lose the weight till way after summenr so i failed again and i feel like i am having a panic attack i want to cry,1,260
i want to be unapologetically insane i am sick of pretending i am fine when people offer me food i want to say let me check the calories first i want to be able to breakdown over tiny events in public because it feels like the world is telling me to starve i want to yell without caring who hears me when someone says something triggering i want to say nah it is disgusting when people ask me if i am enjoying my low calorie food i want to cut my food into tiny pieces when eating with my friends without caring who looks at me weirdly i am just so tired of hiding and pretending i have a healthy relationship with food edit yeah obviously i know this will bring more long term pain than relief and i do not want to shut off people around me it is just so tiring to pretend all the time no need to comment that this is not a good idea because i know it is not and i am not planning on acting this out,1,184
my anorexia story with pictures does anyone else get irrationally annoyed by those videos i have no problem with someone posting about their ed story but i do have a problem when the whole video is essentially a slideshow of weight loss body checks over sad music clearly posted by a quasi recovered girl for validation inevitably half the comments end up being i am only 13 but is it bad that i want her body after she lost weight or you were not even fat before or i weigh 105 pounds and i am the fattest girl in my class this video made me want to starve myself it is always the same story too i was a happy kid then i got bullied became depressed and wanted to go on a diet and stopped eating and look how skinny i got and look how sick and sad i was with a tube up my nose and look how recovered i am now even though i just left inpatient and am still underweight,1,174
recover seriously it is not worth it guys my best friends 28th birthday was last night i know i have relapsed and lost some weight but you never know how much until it is too late i knew what i was going to wear a shirt that used to be too tight on me and a pair of cute trousers i was given as a gift last year that were a size or two too small it would be great to wear something nice when i have been wearing nothing but pjs and leggings while working from home you know what is absolutely humiliating showing up to a fancy dinner wearing workout leggings and a baggy dress shirt because nothing else fits you know what is humiliating going to the gym at 1am because it is a compulsive habit now and passing out on the machine and having people laugh at you and snap photos because they think you tripped waking up in the morning and the world is grey you wake up with a ringing in your ears a pounding headache and cramping sore body feeling intense illness like you could be sick at any point i wish i did not relapse and do this to myself again if you are reading this it is time it is time to put milk cream in your coffee again it is time to start eating the yolk of the egg try a slice of cheese today maybe some toast instead of a rice cake because in the end this is the only body you are given it is not going to take this shit forever and when it is starts to fail you will have wished you would started today c,1,290
does anyone else find it patronizing when skinny people tell you it is okay to gain weight during recovery i hate it when i am discussing my disorder with someone and how it hurts to see myself gain weight when i am already overweight and they hit me with it is normal and healthy to gain weight during recovery sure dude easy for you to say when you are lbs less than me,1,73
laughing out loud anybody else obsessed with the supermarket okay but i literally spend like over an hour in there walking around down every isle and checking calories on everything i have a notes list of products i could should buy because they are insanely low in cals like when i am bored all i want to do it walk to the supermarket and look at food walk around and find new safe foods oh and like hating going with people because it will be a short trip and you cannot stroll around to your liking like what even and they might pick up something high in cals and want to eat it together no thanks i will just go to food land by myself thanks hunny x,1,128
why cannot i have an ed in style i know ed are a mental not physical state but still if i got to have an ed and depression can it at least be cute can i have a skinny white boyfriend and people who help me eat bits of food can i be skinny and make people feel concerned about my bony thighs and ribs sticking out can i have that flat chested and boyish figure like please i already got the disorders where is the fucking aesthetic,1,88

does anyone else feel like being skinny allows them to be weird in public i have a very strong suspicion that i am autistic and part of the reason i want to be skinny is so that my behavior is seen as quirky or cute instead of weird while i was overweight me biting the skin off my cuticles until they bleed was an ew she is gross now it is a awww poor her she is so stressed of course this is just how i think people perceive me so it is probably just projection but i do not know,1,101
shout out to everyone who binged recently fml eating disorder expectations camera pans over the dark room of a teenage girl the window only allowing in the barest amount of light she examines her frail bony figure in the mirror her lifeless eyed and gaunt cheeks are corpse like harsh voice not thin enough we will starve and become beautiful a petite ballerina everyone loves eating disorder reality it is 3am and the camera is panning over the parking lot to schuck s hidden between some trees at the corner is some average sized person with wild eyes holding a family size package of oreos and slamming them into their mouth freeze frame record scratch narrator yeah that is me you are probably wondering how i got into this situation honestly me too the fuck,1,135
anybody else ever feel like their ed is gone for a bit i do not know if this is going to straight up publicly invalidate me but does anybody else ever have periods where inexplicably they can just eat meals that are functional and normal and maintain weight like mentally i am not quite there or uhh even close but i can mindlessly consume functional human levels of food that are not binges or restrictive or can eat a junk meal without purging or melting down fully just makes me feel like my ed is gone and was never really there to begin with and then i convince myself i do not need treatment just in time for it to swing back in full force is this just a me thing or does anybody else occasionally just trick themselves out of an ed for a minute am i going to sound ridiculous here aah,1,154
i get so annoyed when someone says anorexia is really rare yes it is statistically rare but the numbers probably are not as small as you think at least in the us there are around 165 92 million women in the us 9 suffer from anorexia that is rare but it is still 1 493 280 women that is more than the population of estonia there are also those with atypical or undiagnosed anorexia men with anorexia and plenty of others who suffer around the world i probably sound stupid but i just hate when people say this anorexia is not close to non existent,1,105

i regularly get deeply upset that price does not coincide with calories i fantasize about a world where i pay for the amount of calories i consume   like why is not the cheapest option on the menu the least amount of calories i could be saving so much money if the low calorie options were less expensive lol vote me for president and we will all pay per calorie 2020,1,70

anorexia is not romantic people always capture the restrictive parts as if its beautiful but what about the inevitable binges how many people feel like their anorexia is not valid because the inevitable binging is not ever as captured and romanticized discussed the tiny frail girl having just an apple for lunch that is not consistent what about the tiny frail girl sobbing alone in her room after ravenously binging on moldy bread and nut butter after her body gave in and she had to eat the beautiful thin girl having just a diet coke for dinner it is not going to last what about the beautiful thin girl laying in bed too bloated to sleep from her body giving in leading to a whole chocolate cake being eaten at 2 am after she could not sleep from the hunger pains and even if it did stay consistent that bony girl with so much self control who just had celery sticks and hot sauce for lunch is going to end up that poor girl who passed out in the damm washroom from her body being unable to support her after the lack of nutrients i have been in both positions and its not talked about or romanticized and i hate it and hate this,1,214
bullshit pro ana workouts you all remember those posts that would float around on ed tumblr amp insta that were like if you have an ice bath for 20 minutes you will burn 624 calories or the workouts that were like 100 jumping jacks 10 sit ups 10 push ups do this 3 times amp you will burn 300 calories laugh my ass off what crack were these 14 year olds on,1,72
my brother and i were ana buddies without realizing until last night my brother is currently 14 and i am currently 20 last night we were talking and he admitted to me he had an eating disorder about two years ago and i cannot believe i did not notice it obsessively going on runs skipping 2 meals a day and barely eating family dinner and losing weight really fast to where he was skin and bones like severely underweight he also purged regularly and listed off multiple methods to me so i know he is dead serious i knew he was skinny i did not know it was intentional i was too caught up in my own eating disorder to realize he had a problem i did not know i was not the only one passing out in school from not eating and having to be carried to the nurses office for saltines and a paper cup of orange juice he did not know about me either though like me he thought he was the only one little did he know i also had anorexia at the exact same time we would compare weights talk about calories in the foods we were eating we both had fitbits and we would go on runs at 11 30 private message to try to one up the other on step counts we both thought we were being slick and the other would not notice we had an ed and i guess we were right because neither of us noticed we were so disordered we thought it was normal i know my mom saw the paperwork when i was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 17 she is caught me purging before she intentionally fed me smaller portions of food to help me lose weight when i was already underweight she noticed how skeletal my brother was i mean i am talking almost bonespo thin i was never nearly that bad he had the advantage of a growing teenage boy metabolism and expressed concern but did nothing about a year ago she insisted nobody in our family has ever had an eating disorder two out of three kids had anorexia and she did nothing the third one of us has his own issues with gym obsession i am recovered now and so is my brother but the reality of how invisible we were is deeply saddening to me and i think it is going to take me a bit to process this,1,417
when people in recovery say it is okay to gain weight stupid people when i hear eating disorder professionals or people who are have recovered say things like i just had to realize that gaining weight is okay there is nothing bad about it and it is okay and acceptable to gain weight this really makes my blood boil because it implies that all people with eating disorders do not know that which is a huge misconception folks with ed are smart some of the smartest people i have met so this type of connotation is just so degrading when we are recovering from anything weather it is addiction to substance or ed deep down we know the things that are true we know that life without a drug or life with more weight on your body is okay i psychologically know that there is nothing wrong with gaining weight i know when i gain weight it is okay i know that i am still accepted by society and there is nothing wrong with me it is not about the mentality or logistics of the ideology of weight gain it is the physical discomfort the ed and mental illness is not that easy to just tell oh it is okay to gain weight i do not feel comfortable in my body when i gain weight it literally physically feels uncomfortable the weight on my physical body gives me anxiety movement in a body that is gaining weight gives me anger and panic episodes the inflammation of weight gain gives me anxiety and anger and rage when my legs are swollen and puffy or my fingers are too swollen to wear my rings that does not make me feel comfortable so i wish people would understand when they are talking about weight gain and recovery it is not so black and white like that it is not just being okay with weight gain i am okay with weight gain and i have gained quite a bit of weight in comparison to the days when i was anorexic but to make it seem like it is just an easy veil to lift that it is just resizing that it is okay to gain weight that is just not going to be helpful to a large of folks with ed it is mental and physical not just one or the other,1,398
i read this subreddit like it is the morning news or something maybe it is nice to be reminded daily that i am not alone in this plus you all are so funny and supportive i really appreciate this community and want us all to be able to leave one day not in a bad way of course aha,1,59
tiktok gym girls are the absolute worst they always show their glow ups of how skinny and non muscular they were and are like omg it was such a struggle to gain weight literally shut the fuck up it is also annoying how they are literally like do it for yourself yes because getting a massive is totally for myself and not just a different beauty standard it is always really triggering when they post their so called balanced life style which consists of avocado toast smoothies and protein powder like balance where you post on ig for a living while some of them do not have eds i am convinced they just switched ana for ortho end of rant,1,120
i hope everyone who posted a before amp after photo for neda week steps on a lego seriously congratulations on your recovery but you are not posting for awareness you are posting for attention and validation from normies that your suffering is real that is understandable but stop acting like it is a selfless work of mental health activism you are probably harming people with eds more than helping,1,69
resurgence of pro ana noticed everyone has been complaining how there is tons of posts of people humble bragging their ed behaviours one thing i also noticed is that eds can have a certain seasonality to them we are now in late august going into september and that is peak ed season young people have been depressed and hiding away in summer and now school s comming up fast and what does a disordered mind think oh shit cannot hide anymore got to loose weight and got to do it fast and like when you are at that age i am sure you must remember how it was essentially peak clown mode so instead of ranting and raving perhaps you might want to offer these kids some support and kind words in these dire and trying times,1,137
my mom is supportive of my ed and growing up she always said girls with ed are crazy she buys me my safe foods so i will actually eat something she does not judge me if i am almost crying over eating something if i want fast food she will get it for me so quickly because i am actually eating and she wants me to enjoy food there is so many more but she always makes sure i am fed and even if i am not she never judges me just feels sad i guess sometimes if your child goes through something that you previously did not understand you will begin to understand it she is my rock and i would do anything for my mom,1,127
i categorize every single person i see into either the skinnier than me category or fatter than me category literally every person i lay eyes on in the supermarket at work a school does not matter it gets exhausting lol especially when someone is close enough to my weight that i cannot tell which one it is,1,57
i low key think its fucking stupid and self centered to think about yourself and how it will affect your eating disorder in case there is a war like unless you are in the baltic s or ukraine it really does not affect you in your daily life i get that you can be scared but all the posts of people being like why should i recover or oh my god haha we will all starve and i have an ed oh no like making jokes about ww3 and shit is so stupid i cannot even people are dying and its horrible and you cannot think further than yourself and your ed your ed and actual famine and starvation are two completely different things what the actual fuck people edit i am not saying your ed is unvalid i am not saying you cannot be triggered or have feelings about it i am however saying you cannot make this whole fucking war about yourself and how it would personally affect your eating disorder because it inconveniences you because people are dying its literally the kardashian meme of kim people are dying no one cares if you lost your earing if there is a ww3 that would be horrible but i think a lot of people are doing everything they can to prevent that and i do not do this to be a bitch i am just frustrated,1,237
starting to hate every single recovery account youtuber out there oh that is so great that you finally convinced yourself that one single piece of toast will not make you fat and this means you can trust your body and recover into a nice beautifully proportioned healthy weight it is so lovely that you eat one bowl of cereal and feel satisfied and you journal to tell yourself it is all ok and part of the process it is amazing that you gain 5 pounds in recovery and are able to accept it only that i eat 20 pieces of toast rather than just 1 and multiple bowls of cereal and i gain a lot of weight and i just feel even more frustrated because apparently i will have to become overweight because my body does not seem to like a healthy weight anymore even though i used to be there before my ed or maybe i am just fucked and not as lucky as you are,1,167
got asked if i am a lesbian because i have 2 short fingernails nah fam i just got bulimia but tbf i am also queer lol,1,26
nothing captures recovery tiktok more than someone filming themself eating a slice of toast with a thin spread of pb that does not even reach the edges both hands holding it intently staring down at it as they slowly move it towards their mouth to take a tiny bite they are all the same,1,54
i have been eating way too small amount and still not losing weight let me explain and maybe get some anxiety off of you there is how much your body weighs and then there is stuff like water and feces that are not really part of your fat muscle living body but still weigh a bunch so if you eat 500kcal per day but it contains lots of sodium and carbs your body will hold more water than usually you are 100 losing fat muscle but the extra water might make the scale not move or you eat 500kcal per day but that is way too little obviously and longer term restriction has caused your intestines to slow down significantly you have not let out any of that indigestible shit heh and it basically weighs as much as your food you are losing fat muscle but your scale will not move that is all calories are all that matters and if you are eating an impossibly unhealthily small amount of food you are 1000 losing weight the scale is just not the best arbitur for what you are losing in those two scenarios you can probably do the math and see what you lost in true weight if you are a nerd like me it is actually surprisingly accurate considering a 100kcal lower tdee since i am uw and has probably caused my thyroid to not work well oh and up to 200 less if you have lost your period,1,250
why food have caloery i hate it here,1,8
i am not counting the calories in my tomato today i have been waiting months for this bad boy to grow i am about to enjoy it without a scent of guilt here is the picture,1,36
is anyone else fascinated by people s complete lack of knowledge about calories yesterday my mom made fried rice with tons of oil yikes and probably since there were vegetables in it my dad was like this is healthy i tell him it is not and that rice has a lot of calories and he is completely shocked he thought rice was very low calorie which kind of baffles me he also complained yesterday that he did not lose any weight this week he is been doing heavy construction so i tell him losing weight is mostly diet i then say that running 5 miles will only burn about 500 cals which shocks him again it is just kind of weird to me how people seem to have no perception of calories unless they have followed a strict diet or have an ed edit by the way my dad and i are close and i was not trying to burst his bubble or anything laugh my ass off,1,168
i was just walking out of class when i heard some guy in the hallway yell i do not care about you and your starvation mode to that guy same,1,30

a guy today bought me dinner because he said it looked like i needed it i just relocated out of state and i went to a local restaurant i was only drinking water with lemon naturally and after about 1 5 hours this super drunk guy was ordering food to go and pointed to me and said get this girl dinner on me because it looks like she needs it i was freaking out so i went over to him and asked what was going on he told me i am the skinniest person he has seen in x county and i do not have an ounce of fat on my body it was so freaking validating hearing that with his permission i ordered the most expensive thing on the menu and ate it all i have nothing else to say other than i feel very happy right now,1,149

two and a half months ago i almost died in the hospital yesterday i made a junior national time cut for swimming recovery has changed my life i am far from where i was before covid and my anorexia hit it is peak but it is so great to be back in the water and actually have the energy to swim for a while my performance was going downhill due to restriction and muscle atrophy but now that i am in recovery i can swim so much better my coach even commented on how much stronger i looked anyway i am just super happy and want to let you all know that recovery sucks but can also be amazing at times,1,121
reality check what you do is abnormal and it is an illness browsing ed subs everyday brutally normalised my behaviour in my mind and even minimised it seeing others here seem to be doing a lot worse than me the other day i casually explained some ed stuff to a non disordered person they were so shocked that for a moment i could see how far gone i am this illness makes you think what you are doing is not that serious it devalidates your suffering and your feelings even now as i am typing i can barely wrap my head around the fact that what i do is a nightmare to many people because it feels so mundane point at your illness whenever you notice it in your everyday life acknowledging it is a good step towards conquering it,1,140
the way people delegitimize me for eating 1500 calories i am a 19 yo guy and my whole life pretty much revolves around numbers calorie count weight daily steps i ate lunch like an hour ago and as i write this i am already planning my meals for not only tonight but all of tomorrow as well laugh my ass off anyway though people love to tell me my ed is fake because i restrict to 1 500 and say i have to be sub 1k to actually be affected in fact one of my friends who is amazing love her sm she just does not understand at all said she does not think i have an ed because she says 1500 calories is hard for her to reach because it is too many ok love but you are also a girl that is like five inches tinier than me adults always mention i am way too thin but it is usually girls my age that tell me i am exaggerating my entire condition my other pet peeve is when people comment that i am cured because i eat a meal i ate three chipotle tacos in one sitting after running six miles that morning and having half a sandwich for lunch and a friend was like see i knew you did not have an eating disorder look how much you ate thanks lovely now i want to starve myself for the next three days because you commented i just cannot believe people with and without eds feel a need to gatekeep we are in this struggle together and it is just hurtful that i cannot even feel safe to talk about it with people because they think it is not real ugh,1,293
you cannot have eating disorder i saw you eat a snickers yes that was my only food i had that day i swear some people still think people with ed s live off of apples and rice cakes,1,38

rant about how toxic ed spaces are to binge eaters if this is too inflammatory take it down i do not want to be toxic but i am so tired of coming on this application and wading through the 300000 posts about how recovery promotes binge eating i am tired of people who will shamelessly tell all of social media they would rather die of a restrictive ed than struggle with binge eating something i have to deal with every day i am tired of feeling like a failure because i spent my recovery on a meal plan when i wanted to just eat intuitively but was scared and started binge eating and now i long to intuitive eat so badly and it looks like the only way to be happy with food but supposedly i can never achieve it because once you have an eating disorder you will never intuitive eat and it is always a binge etc it is so exhausting why is it ok to diagnose a stranger on the internet with bed because they are eating a lot to help their disorder imagine if it was the other way around how disgusting and offensive most people would see that as i know i am being too sensitive but jesus it is hard,1,216
the dreaded anorexic vagina has struck me i have been to my gp i have been to a gyno i was referred to i have used enough lube to turn my entire house into a slip and slide i have used dilators and still i tear every single time my bf and i have sex right now i have got a 3mm tear on my perineum a 1 2mm tear on the left of my labia minora a 0 7mm tear on my right labia minora and a tear of unknown length starting at the entrance of my vagina and continuing inside i have to apply barrier cream 3 times a day to help it heal it hurts to sit it hurts to walk it hurts to lie on my back because it puts pressure on the area and it hurts to lie on my side unless my legs are completely straight i cannot poop normally because pushing reopens the tear so i am having to give myself enemas in the shower so that i do not have to strain the gyno essentially said that everything should be in working order but for some reason my skin is not stretching as much as it should she suggested it could be an issue with my diet causing me to produce inadequate amounts of collagen i need to eat more protein and take vitamin supplements for 4 months and she said that still might not solve it i am not even underweight and only fell back into my relapse march last year and it means that at 23 i might be producing so little collagen that my vagina cannot stretch without ripping open fellow anorussy sufferers please give advice or cry with me laugh my ass off,1,295
does anyone else feel like they waste calories when they eat something subpar i do not know exactly how to explain this but anytime i eat something and it is not as good as i expected i get really anxious and feel like i wasted calories and then start engaging in behaviors the other night i bit into a stale oreo and felt like it was a waste of calories so i gt  c s  lt on a bunch of cookies after and just last night i had a pear that was not quite ripe and was not flavorful at all and after throwing half of it away i paced around my room for 30 minutes just to make the anxiety go away,1,123

asian culture regarding weight is toxic and fuels my ed i was dreading coming home for the holidays because i knew how blunt my parents would be regarding my weight i have gained 20lbs in the past year when i came home for break last winter i would been at my lowest weight and was restricting below 500 my friends convinced me to tell my therapist who sent me to a nutritionist on campus and pushed me to refeed i let myself eat regularly over the summer which i did not spend at home and kept it up into this past semester and now i am relapsing hard and trying to lose weight again the first thing my dad said to me when i stepped into the house was you need to start losing weight it is unhealthy to be this fat i am in normal bmi range for my height by a long shot my mom comments at least once every few hours about how much fatter i look and how you do not fit into your old pants do you while eating dinner on my first day back they ordered papa john s pizza amp wings and said she eats so well no wonder she is gained so much weight we would just spent the whole day moving into our new house i spend my breaks working at my dad s sushi restaurant which is mostly staffed by older korean adults every single damn day someone assumes they have the right to make some fucking comment about how much weight i have gained shit like i guess you just gain more and more weight each time we see you and look at her she is so chubby these days yesterday while at work i had a complete mental breakdown in public i was trying not to cry behind the host stand my dad came over to ask what was wrong and i just fucking broke down in front of him i told him how every single time anybody sees me they make comments about how fat i am and how much it fucking hurts i promised him through my tears and rage that i would stop eating for fucking good if that is what everyone wanted from me one of the sushi chefs who would commented just a few minutes prior came over to apologize i did not respond i was wiping tears away while giving takeout orders to ubereats drivers and showing customers to their seats it was fucking humiliating this is all just to say asian particularly korean culture regarding weight is so fucking toxic everyone thinks they have the right to say something that could be hurtful to anybody to me just because we are friends and they do not give a fuck about mental illnesses my family members have called me fat for as long as i can fucking remember as i have always been a chubby kid they compare me to my younger sister who is 5 years younger than me has not fully gone through puberty yet and was blessed with amazing genes i have fucking had enough i have never felt so motivated in my life to get as sick as i possibly can when i hit my ugw and i am withering away to nothing but bones and depression they will eat their fucking words and regret everything and they wonder why i have an eating disorder edit everyone here is so damn lovely and supportive you did not have to gild this but thank you so much and thank you to everyone who is left a comment it means so so much to me that there is a community out there for me in which i can find comfort when my family and friends turn their backs on me i hope everyone had a great holidays and is staying safe,1,651
anyone else annoyed with thin influencers telling you it is ok to eat and you deserve food and then when they post a photo of themselves bloated from thanksgiving they are still smaller than you before you even consume anything like i get maybe their intentions are pure but honestly  shut up,1,52
what is the most disgusting thing your ed made you do happened because of your ed i will start 2 years ago a had a huge binge the night before an important exam as you do instead of learning obviously i was way too tired to keep on purgeing so i took some laxatives and went to bed next morning nothing happend and i thought i became resistant so i put on a dress and left of course 10 minutes before the exam started i shit myself no warning it just happened i went to the toilet and tried to clean up as much as possible which was nt really doing anything so i took the 3 hour long exam in my shitty underwear and a short dress i was so afraid someone would notice anything and after about 2 hours i also got my period one of the worst things i ever expirienced still got a good grade though,1,160

16 and anorexia is going to kill me very soon please read and please stop while you can please trigger warning numbers this is the most important year of high school junior year and i am going to either die in a little bit or fail at life completely i hit an all time lw recently of gt  bmi 11 2  lt and i am barely alive right now to be honest i am miserable and sluggish and slow and i cannot think i can hardly breathe deep or walk without the floor ripping out from under me and i am so cold i cannot even focus on anything but the mind numbing pain of the cold that is ripping through the very core of my bones i feel like my hearts not even in my chest and i cannot focus on school work or clubs and i definitely cannot do a sport so i am just completely uninvolved in any kind of extracurricular job and i am failing school at the ripe age of 16 my hair is ripping out of my head and my teeth are visible through my skull my skin is a mottled gray i am hideous of course to make my life a little more miserable and slightly more unbearable i have to start having mini seizures probably endured from malnutrition or something akin coupled with other various stages of what i would guess to be organ failure so now i get the joy of being barley able to do anything at all no driving no job no hobbies no real friends no family that cares all i do is starve and starve and exercise day and night i just walk around my town in endless circles to burn off the little crap i eat my dog is afraid of me because i look so monstrous people in public look at me with either pity or disgust all my friends have dates to homecoming already and beautiful dresses and i am unable to even think of going and making memories it is not worth it i should have never fallen into this hole i am going to die sad and misera and alone at just 16 years old i just do not understand why me i do not understand what i did to deserve this i do not understand why my parents do not care or love me enough to get me help i do not understand why i do not want it i know this reads dramatic but if you have the chance please try to at least do harm reduction or else you will die literally die and not a romantic poetic suicide a slow drawn out torturous death as you watch in horror and a frantic beating frenzy as you skip and slip down that deep dark hole knowing this is not what you really want but you cannot stop the only thing i have going for me right now is that i am skinny but that does not even matter because i am so miserable i cannot even enjoy the body i have killed my self over and over and over again for it was worthless a meaningless existence defined by the simple fact of being thin that knowledge is more painful than any other symptom,1,555
i hate how often people s reaction to finding out about an ed is well you will not look good if you are too skinny thanks my 1 consideration about this disorder that has the highest death rate of any mental illness is whether i will make your dick hard if i get to the point where i am dying i probably do not hear this as often as women do because i am a guy but i still get it sometimes since i like men and other dudes suck lol i also see it online a lot and i just why should people s primary concern be about if you think they are attractive instead of the mental impacts or passing out or organ failure same with people telling severely underweight people that they do not look attractive like that it is not magically going to cure them their disorder is not thinking about you aaaaaaa,1,157
if you go to a protest please eat i just left one being walked to my moms car by a complete stranger i did not eat at all today i usually do not it is 85 degrees amp i rode my bike like 2 miles to get there i was in the crowd with a new group of friends amp i started to lose my vision i blacked out they walked me over to a cement block while i threw up in front of the people i had just befriended a stranger rubbed my back as i threw up amp two more poured water down my back amp got me a cliff bar to eat do you know what my first thought was as they gave me this granola bar what should i cut out of dinner tonight to compensate for eating this i have never blacked out in public before let alone in the middle of a crowd in front of new friends but there is a first for everything i guess i am so worried i embarrassed them please save yourself the embarrassment just fucking eat if you go to one of these even if it is just some crackers or a rice cake,1,206
well here is a weird ass situation i 23m was kind of pressured into eating a meal last night by a housemate who i am very very fond of not something i would ever choose to eat he cooked it did not feel like eating in the first place and i reckon if that was my family or something i would have just been pissed off but he is a kind fella and was apparently annoyed and worried that he had not seen me eat a meal for days so the bugger sat me down fed me some food that i was nervous as fuck to eat but was incredibly tender about it not paying too much attention to me or anything whilst he cleaned up it felt so odd to have somebody who realistically barely knows me actively encourage me to eat a meal no aggression or anything but a certain firmness he is also a fair bit older than me but i do not know how much of a difference that actually ends up making god damn having other people give a shit without being aggressive and or angry can be very relieving thank you r for not making me feel under pressure but giving me some firm encouragement and accepting when i say i really cannot take any more,1,222
got blood work done to figure out why i had unusual bruising on my legs called the doc today and found out i essentially have scurvy i am vitamin c deficient as hell thanks to years of anorexia and a rollercoaster of eating habits developed strange bruises behind my knees and it spread to my lower thighs anyway this went on for awhile until i began to experience more and more pain in my joints and throughout my body eventually i got an appointment with my dermatologist to check out my skin turns out just got to eat more fruits and veggies or else i am going to die of scurvy an 18 century disease that killed pirates laugh my ass off hope this serves as a cautionary tale for you all,1,132
does anyone else binge more when there is more pressure to be thinner getting photos taken 2 weeks later binge a customer left a yelp review saying i am fat binge why do i do this i hate this,1,39
3 years recovered boyfriend says he had to really adjust to my weight gain now i am back at square one also trigger warning for p right now addiction because someone told me to put that i started dating my boyfriend when i was 17 and pretty deep into my ed i was never ridiculously skinny but definitely underweight the kind that looks good to guys though i guess but to maintain it i basically had to eat next to nothing i am now 21 he is 24 and we have been going through a really rough patch because he is addicted to porn lmao long fucking story definitely has not done wonders for my self esteem but i have felt until now like my self worth and confidence was only tied to him in healthy ways since recovering i gained about gt  20lbs  lt i was gt  100  lt when we met bmi gt  18 3  lt and now my bmi is about gt  22  lt at 5 0 it is definitely a significant change i have some extra fat on my arms and stomach and face that i had to get used to but i also filled out and became more shapely so it was an ok trade off i am going to he was always supportive i thought a couple nights ago we were having a really tough conversation we have been on the edge of breaking up a few times recently due to his dishonesty and the way it is affected our relationship in the spirit of trying to be more honest he told me that my weight gain has played a role in his porn addiction because it took a lot of adjusting and he is never been with someone like that he even apparently talked to his therapist about it and how it made him feel like a bad person i immediately started crying because that is like legitimately my worst fear the fact that we have had sex hundreds of times since i gained weight and i always thought it was safe to assume he was attracted to me and he was not like just kill me atp lol i have been literally making an effort in the past year to hide my tummy during sex less because i always thought he liked it like i literally just look like a normal not rail thin adult woman and i thought that was fine so fucking embarrassing my god as soon as i started crying he started backtracking and saying it was more about how he could tell i lost confidence which i did not after recovery i was more confident so that is clearly bullshit he fully knows i had an ed too and i was already starting a diet to she would maybe gt  5lbs  lt when he said this it was honestly so unnecessary and hurtful but honesty ig and now my ed is back in full swing i have lost gt  9lbs  lt in 5 days all the normal food in my pantry has been replaced with low cal 0 sugar lean options which sucks because in recovery i got really into cooking and making beautiful food of all kinds but there is no way that would not feel like bingeing to me now i am starting at gt  1500  lt cal a day and once i stop losing weight i am going to do gt  1200  lt etc but i am already restricting as low as i feel possible literally had some lean granola and 0 sugar yogurt a gt  100cal  lt granola bar yesterday i felt dizzy all day and loved it i am weighing everything i eat and aiming way below my calorie goal i feel like a flip has switched in my brain it is like all the things your ed brain tells you about recovery have come true people do think you look more beautiful when you are sick they are just being nice to get you healthy your body will never be healthy and beautiful that is just not for you everyone is lying to you i am already getting re addicted to all my old behaviours it is happening so fast and i am completely committed to undoing all of my recovery i cannot believe this is happening to me but i know it is out of my control at this point fuck my life man i was doing so well for so long,1,751
gone down a weird tunnel of what i eat in a day as a fat person not trying to lose weight anyone else it is so satisfying to watch these tiktoks i do not know why i have been watching them every night before bed but i have watched all the compilations on youtube already i tried mukbangs but not really my thing too forced and slurpy maybe its the food freedom they have that i want but the lack of veggies is usually shocking to me who eats like 50 fruits and veggies so my post got locked i guess but i wanted to add why i like the videos after more thought 1 the ladies i watch are all british so they have wonderful accents and usually very pretty nails so they like lift up this food and look so pretty and then they describe it it was banging i do not know so satisfying to watch 2 a lot of them are like i am a fat b tch and i do not care what you think and i love that attitude 3 i think most of the ones i watch are honest they eat a lot and do not show drinks alcohol usually they definitely eat enough to gain weight if they are short and stationary,1,220
i am so tired of people acting like anorexia is the only eating disorder recovery is worth it i am having a single slice of bread for the first time in four decades this is your sign to recover like girl i had half a loaf of bread the other day because i got sad,1,55
3 meals a day did not make me gain weight 3 meals a day did not make me gain weight the garlic dip sandwiches did the entire pizzas i would eat regularly did the 2 family bags of doritos i could get through and my family normalising eating today i learned i hurt made me obese the constant bingeing and purging is not normal i wish i could unhook my brain from these fucking chains i cannot believe i have to remind myself of this every time i do not want to eat a filling salad i want because its the same calories as a burger or deny myself a banana because it is not worth it then binge and purge and eat more than i would have if i would ate the dumb banana anyway normal people enjoy the odd cheeky mcdonald s and it does not haunt their day or drive an urge to binge or whatever so boring sick of it i am telling myself this over and over to correct my disordered eating i wish i did not care about how many grams of butter is on my toast going from an obese teen to starving and underweight has just fried my fucking brain more than i thought it is like my brain is traumatised i cannot convince myself food is not the most important thing in my life even though my weight is totally normal i cannot imagine being 40 and still thinking like this need a fucking brain scan bro,1,256
i am koala 1 only eats one food 2 will starve and refuse to eat even if put in a room full of food 3 sleep a lot 4 small brain 5 screams thank you for coming to my tedtalk,1,40
how stupid to they think we are i get that purging is bad i have not purged in 2 years but it is always annoyed me when people try to use flat out lies to scare us such as purging does not really get rid of the food as if i cannot fucking see the full noodles from the spaghetti in my purge it feels condescending and infantilizing frankly it just makes me want to do it more to prove them wrong maybe if someone had focused on warning me about gastroparesis i would have been more worried it is by far the worse consequence i have suffered from purging but people think we are too stupid to understand something like gastroparesis i have always understood it just underestimated it anyways i just hate when people assume those with eating disorders are stupid i have a fucking degree i speak 4 languages there are doctors with eating disorders rant over sorry about the typo in the title i cannot edit it,1,171
i am a tired of the you deserve to eat be good to yourself food is fuel for your body you need food posts and remarks even though i am in recovery and doing really well actually these type of motivational posts messages whatever still annoy me i know people who say this stuff are just trying to help but it does not help at all and it is frankly kind of cringey to me if you have ever had an ed yourself you know damn well it does not matter how many times you tell a severely mentally ill person that if you are reading this go get a snack you deserve it xoxo it will not work it is not that simple of course i know my body needs food to function and survive of course i know i am supposed to eat like a normal human being it is like saying just look on the bright side to a depressed person amp  x200b edit sorry for the title i do not know how i did not realize i messed up when proofreading it haha,1,187

tik tok skinnys god i am so tired of seeing all these tiny girls dancing around in skirts it makes me so repulsed with myself but not its become thinspo for me and a slight addiction,1,36
does anyone else hate it when their non disordered friends talk about how they do not eat breakfast or lunch and just do not feel hungry in general tw not eating probably posted before just really feeling it right now because there was a whole discord conversation where friends were talking about how they did not eat breakfast and one in particular said that he did not eat breakfast had only water for lunch and ate about a piece of bread for dinner i know he does not have an ed and is just exaggerating things but to me in recovery with 3 meals and 2 snacks it feels like a jab that i am not restricting enough,1,118
i refuse to eat a meal but then binge on snacks ending up eating more calories than if i just had a meal way to be ed,1,27
the only reason i am not an alcoholic is because alcohol has calories amp the only reason i am not a completely useless fucking stoner is because weed is expensive and a hassle to get amp the only reason i am not just popping xan hydro daily is because i do not have access to those consistently either but goddamn would i love to be constantly numb to my own existence,1,71
my professor asked the class how many calories we eat in a day i have never been so triggered in my life the class is not even nutritional focused but on our introduction assignment today he fucking asked how many calories do you consume in a day and do you exercise then he walked around and commented on some student s answers he said things like x amount how are you eating that much and hmm x you sure a lot of people eat more than they think what the fuck i was on the verge of a panic attack hoping he would not look down at what i put and say something luckily he did not but i geniunely think i would have cried if he did this was how i started my day and i have not been able to get it out of my mind since every time i tried to eat today i thought about him what the fuck,1,163
i cannot think of a single good reason to post your before recovery photos at an extremely low weight i cannot think of a single good reason to post your before photos of before you recovered if you were at an extremely low weight like come on there is no way you could live through the experience of being anorexic and not know exactly what you are doing i have seen this a few times on tik tok a platform where videos randomly flash across your fyp based on the algorithm so you do not seek them out most of the time and it is especially funny that they will put tw ed on the first slide which is a picture of their emaciated bodies they are not just candid photos either they are half ass if not fully naked pulling their skin over their ribs titling their pelvis to emphasize the thigh gap sucking in ect just very obvious thinspo poses i am spreading awareness spreading awareness that yes you were sick and you achieved that low weight low weight anorexics have the most awareness of anyone in the ed community i want to show others who are suffering how bad it can get someone else suffering with a restrictive ed will think one of two things upon seeing these photos 1 i do not look anything like that so i do not need to recover 2 i want to look like that and you have shown it is possible to do and survive so i do not want to recover i am not responsible for your triggers i can understand this if it was something unreasonable like some people are triggered by the color blue and you cannot expect someone to accommodate that but it costs zero dollars to not post underweight body check photos and when the discourse around it is that it is generally harmful why continue to do it to a community you supposedly want to recover i know why because nobody who is truly recovered would do this,1,344

sorry kind lady at the drugstore this morning i went to the drugstore to buy a scale for food for the first time i asked her a few questions about the scale and took the cheapest one when she said is this for you you look completely fine you do not have to lose weight and i was like hihi i am just being careful she eyed me kindly and she said be careful not to fall into anorexia and i was like me anorexia oh no i am just healthy eating and being mindful she asked me more questions and i had to lie saying i used to overweight and eat all the time and now i was just being careful but i could see she was still worried she told me about her daughter that used to be anorexic my heart was breaking i felt so bad eventually she let me buy the scale and let me go after i promised her to be careful i am sorry i lied to you thank you for being concerned edit okay you guys just made me realize that maybe her questions were kind of inappropriate and they definitely made me uncomfy any how i really think she was just trying to look out for me even though it was not her place to do so edit 2 yes she did start by asking me if i was selling drugs laugh my ass off,1,243
i just want to be skinny so i can die already i have been fantasizing about killing myself for years now but whenever i do it is always sometime in the future where i am skinny and successful or whatever i literally cannot go an hour without thinking about suicide but i really do not want to be remembered as a fat ugly worthless whore who never achieved anything i genuinely do not think i will ever be good at anything so if i keep waiting for that i will die when i am like eighty and i refuse to wait that long so when i die i at least want to be skinny it sounds so shallow and dumb written out like this especially when i know i will not even be remembered in a few generations but i have been thinking about suicide since i was about nine i remember when i was thirteen fourteen ish and thinking that i could loose some weight and write some songs and then die in a few years but it is been a few years and i am still fat with no achievements i hate myself so much that i am nauseated whenever i even think about myself because i am so disgusting and worthless i do not know if this is the best place to post this but if i tell my therapist i will just get sent to a psych ward edit typo and it is sad how many upvotes this has,1,253
welp i did it i had a hysterectomy yesterday morning at 8 30am i ended my 10 year long struggle with my faulty uterus unlike many here i never fit in with the absentee period crowd though i know that is just as dangerous i had the eternal periods for example from sept 2018 to sept 2019 alone i bled for 236 days i would tried every birth control under the sun and almost all of them made my migraines worse i have seen specialists i have had two surgeries already endometriosis had all sorts of tests and imaging and have done my own research for what seems like forever i have been so anemic i could not leave my house to go for a walk i was a shadow of myself a depressed she will all this bleeding exacerbated my ed between trying to restrict to lose my period to depression eating i have been so incredibly unhappy with my body i felt like it was rebelling against me at every turn mood but not anymore i may be exhausted bloated from all the air they pumped into me in pain and afraid to take a deep breath or to go poop lol    but i am free i am making an effort to eat what i need to heal my dumb fuckin lizard brain is having to take a backseat i refuse to let this monster jeopardize my health and healing damnit but really i am just so happy to be done with this horrible chapter and i do not know if anyone here has suffered the same bleeding issues or has ever had or considered a hysterectomy but i am here if you have questions anyway thanks to anyone who read this and thanks for letting me share much love,1,302
ventured out for groceries found monster zero for 1 each decided food was overrated i have never felt so judged at a check out counter in my life i was so excited in my mismatched socks and fenty slides oversized band tee and hair that has not been brushed in 3 days until i made eye contact with the cashier he literally stared at all of the boxes of monster in my buggy like it was fucking corona virus and i was trying to give it to him or something like tf i know you do not want to be here sir but can we get to ringing he looks at me and goes wow guy in your life really needs his monsters huh me a dumbass oh these are for me do you have apple pay i accidentally picked up this gross habit of not even being ashamed n just living my disgusting truth pray 4 me sis,1,159
skinny shaming is not the same as fat shaming they will never be comparable,1,14
me i will not abuse lax that is one line i will not cross even for my ed also me takes 600mg caffeine pills to aggravate my ibs for the exact same effect amp  x200b i am a model of health and mental stability,1,44
i guarantee you had a better day than me friendly reminder not to break a fast with grapes i just shit on the floor of the grocery store yeah wearing a super cute skirt shopping for more fruit and oh wait i think i need to fart    nope that is diarrhea that just exited my body and landed on the aisle floor of my local grocery store my actual life that is a literal moment of my life there is camera footage of me out there casually shopping and then randomly setting my basket down and bolting for the exit guys i can die now i have seen enough,1,109
i watched to the bone and it triggered me but in a really weird way eli has a family and people who care about her she starts recovery because of her mom she meets a guy who is into her and flirts with her she is gorgeous i do not give a fuck how skinny she was i want a family and people who are close to me i want people to be into me and know that someone cares about me that scene where her mother feeds her got me balling i want a mom to hold me i want people to be concerned about my health to care maybe not the right sub to post but whatever,1,119
someone yelled body positivity at me when i wore a bikini for the first time in months i was at a party with a a few friends and some of the girls got into the pool with their bikinis so i also decide to take a dip and as i enter the pool the slimmest girl in the group yells yessss my name body positivity i know that she did not mean anything negative by that but it just makes me feel so huge and the thing is i know i am not fat i am literally below average weight for my height and age not heroin chic thin but still conventionally thin or fit as i go to the gym a lot maybe i am just overthinking this because you should be body positive at every size but i guess i just associate it with people that are larger this should not affect me that much but apparently it is i do not even know how to move on from this and it is so stupid,1,177
it is impossible for me to fathom how people do not spend there every waking moment concerned with food 98 percent of my thoughts are consumed by planning my meals having anxiety attacks about what i ate and comparing my body to others it blows my mind that most people do not obsess over this stuff i try to stay away from triggering materials like cheat day or what i ate today videos on youtube to try and get my mind off food but i always seemed to get sucked right back in what i would give to be free from this prison of a disorder,1,106
does anyone else cycle between restriction and just normal eating because oh man its invalidating i feel like it is very common for people to cycle through binge restrict cycles but i have never really experienced that rather than binge  restrict it is more like just restrict not restrict i go through periods of eating a relatively normal healthy amount and then out of nowhere it gets super easy to restrict for a few weeks and there are so many reasons why this makes me feel like a fake whiney baby eating a normal amount makes me feel fake because i clearly am not repulsed by food and i do not have to force it down i enjoy it i mean during these periods my thoughts are exactly the same as when i restrict and i always would rather be restricting i feel the same guilt over the food i eat but i still eat it in the first place since developing an ed i have lost weight pretty consistently only gaining real weight when i have gone on vacation or during holidays but i lose weight slowly as fuck i have lost only 35lbs since last may and i have been having these disordered thoughts for almost the entire time but where the fuck am i suffering i clearly do not have an issue with the act of eating if i decided to recover i feel like it would be relatively easy for me because i fucking love food i feel like some wannarexic lmao i want to restrict 100 of the time and lose weight super quickly but i cannot because i do not actually have an eating disorder i am just forcing one even though i have restricted to the point where i am underweight i just feel like i do not match any criteria for any eating disorders i have no binging or purging issues so i do not see how i could have ednos but i feel like i eat normally enough of the time for anorexia to be wrong as well part of the reason i want to lose even more weight at this point is because if i am underweight enough then i know i have an eating disorder for sure this post is a mess lmao i am just sick of my own bullshit and i do not know how common this is,1,401
anal is now my laxative of choice cw tw for an unhinged sexual activities x ed crossover my boyfriend came over last night to get an early start on valentine s day we spent most of the day snuggling watching movies after i used my morning amp early afternoon to cook him my special pasta and brownies we were rewatching sons of anarchy since it is our favorite and cue the sex scene halfway through the first ep show is now just background fodder and we get busy all is well as a couple we are two sexually hyperactive degenerates that fit together perfectly in all but one area anal it is not a make or break for him but he likes it i was a hard no he has a habit of joking like i am going to put it in your ass if you do not shut up when i start teasing him usually i pretend scream run maybe it was the 4 glasses of wine in me talking but i was like ayo all is still well first time i have actually liked anal with anyone ever cut to 4 5am about 3 hours later there is a rumbling in my loins i free myself from his grasp no time to explain when he wakes and questions me all sleepy and sad like reach toilet unleash weigh letting him get to 5th made me shit out gt  4 2  lt pounds way better than other lax whatever he was doing felt right and good wibta if i said yes to anal more often so i can finally shit i am usually so constipated,1,276

restrictive purge eds are not caused by diet culture or beauty standards or fatphobia i am going to lose my everloving mind if i see one more tiktok or instagram post about restrictive purge eating disorders being caused by diet culture beauty standards fatphobia and i will lose it even worse if the post goes on to suggest that if we get rid of diet culture beauty standards fatphobia there would not be any more eds and if the post suggests that people who have eds are inherently fatphobic i just might spontaneously combust in my mind takes like you have an ed so you are fatphobic are just as ignorant lacking in nuance lacking in empathy and honestly lacking in common sense as you have depression so you just cry all day or you have schizophrenia so you have voices that tell you to kill people some people with depression cry all day some people with schizophrenia hear violent voices and some people with eds are fatphobic not all not even most not even a large percentage if restrictive purge eds were caused by diet culture or beauty standards or fatphobia why do we have records of these disorders dating back from the 1500s and earlier when diet culture did not exist and the beauty standard was larger bodies as a symbol of wealth in today s culture the beauty standard is thicc why is it then that people are not trying to restrict purge themselves into an hourglass shape why is the goal underweight why do men have restrictive purge eds when the beauty standard has never been tiny and skinny for them when diet culture that targets men is focused on getting shredded and huge there are so many reasons someone might develop a restrictive purge ed eds can come from a need to feel in control as a method of sh because someone tried to recover from their bed and fell into restriction instead from an addiction to watching the numbers on the scale go down an addiction to hunger highs a need to feel accomplished ocd the food is contaminated i need to avoid it purge it as a way to physically manifest internal pain feeling like if you are sickly and fragile people will love you more a desire to make yourself unattractive after being sa d as a way to alleviate dysphoria losing your period etc a desire to go back to childhood when you were small and cared for a way of having something to focus on other than your pain a desire to shrink yourself so much you totally disappear usually after trauma or abuse as a long term method of suicide an addiction to the feelings of power caused by successfully restricting purging etc because that is how your parents were and you did not realize it was not normal because you wanted the sense of community found in ed circles etc i could go on and on none of those reasonings have anything to do with or would be solved by ending fatphobia or diet culture or beauty standards but there are people with eds who developed them to be pretty or because they are fatphobic sure but here is the thing the vast majority of people do not feel attractive enough at some point in their life there are unfortunately many fatphobic people in the world and yet the overwhelming majority of these people do not develop debilitating lethal disorders because of it a mentally healthy person does not deal with those feelings by restricting or purging getting rid of fatphobia or beauty standards is not going to fix what the people who developed eds for that reason were struggling with before their ed so please tiktok activists and instagram coaches for the love of god stop saying that shit eta okay i want to clarify because i think my frustration fueled rant was not particularly articulate in some ways my point was not beauty standards never have an impact on anyone s ed ever it was there are hundreds of things that can because or significantly contribute to an ed that have nothing to do with beauty standards or diet culture despite the outside perception of eds being eds are 100 caused by not feeling attractive enough thinking being fat is ugly this leaves many people with inadequate resources for recovery when so much of it is focused on loving your body with little attention to other factors it also does not take into account that even for people whose main reason is to fit beauty standards mentally healthy people do not respond to not fitting beauty standards by starving themselves or purging 99 99 of the time there are underlying factors or mental health issues involved too that would not be cured by stopping beauty standards and those are important to address in recovery as well,1,820
letsstopactinglikeeatingisapersonalitytrait i am looking at you skinny instagram influencers who do not eat but like to pose with big ass slices of pizza i am looking at you attractive celebrities who think you are so quirky because you gasp eat fuck you for making food so ingrained into our culture fuck you because now i am pressured into eating whenever i am out with other people because everyone else wants to pretend they love to eat fuck you because you are making it look worse when i do not want to eat and most importantly fuck you for promoting the idea that genetics stumps cico,1,105

the normalisation of doing whatever it takes to be thin in japan is real so i have been studying in japan for several months and to be honest the thin culture here is insane back home i would be an xxs or even shop in the kids section for clothes i know i am slightly taller than most girls here but even so i am still a medium here diet foods and culture are rife here with high fibre sodas diet pills in on the go packs at 7 eleven and weight loss clinic ads hitting you left right and centre today one of my dorm mates accidentally found out about my ed and the word spread but rather than being met with concern i was met with yo if you need to throw up there is a different bathroom for that to avoid making the other bathrooms smell bad keep it clean there is scales under the sink if you need them i am just genuinely so suprised and do not know what to feel about all this my ed has not been as bad in japan and i feel fortunate i am stronger than i used to be but i feel like if i were struggling as bad as i had in the past i would end up dying here before my study abroad year ended,1,228

does anyone else look at a picture of themselves from when they were a literal child like 5 6 and think damn i wish i was that skinny again even though you are now a freaking adult title says it all edit i had posted this on here as kind of a joke and to poke fun at how messed up my mentality to my body is but seeing all the responses now both of people who relate to what i said and people on the opposite spectrum who hated how they looked as a child because they were considered fat obese it breaks my heart a little that we cannot look at our childhood photos and find some sense of happiness and contentment i hope that we all as a community can find some peace and happiness soon recovery is possible we do not have to love our bodies every day but we can work towards being able to live neutrally in our bodies and have gratitude for what it does speaking into existence that we all process any and all trauma hurtful words and actions that have manifested itself into this painful often life long disorder edit 2 i would love to go back in time and give childhood me and you guys all the love and compassion i want to reply to every comment but i cannot find the right words for everyone this is a collective we are all strong and great people despite our challenges much love,1,252

you are lucky you are naturally slim just wait until you are 30 that is when you start gaining weight bruh shut the entire fuck up 1 there is nothing natural about my size 2 i do not want to be told i am inevitably going to gain weight 3 you are the reason i will never recover not to mention that i was told something similar when i was a teenager but it was about gaining weight when you are in your 20s and i swear when you are 30 it will be about after having kids then it will be menopause that makes you just ballooooon up sweetie does it ever end will people ever stop telling you when you are going to stop being naturally skinny reminding you of when the fatness will catch up to you i am so sick of it all i do not care that many people gain weight with age saying there is no way out of it and telling me to enjoy my disordered body while it lasts is not helpful and it honestly makes me want to die,1,188

my professor commented on my body in front of the whole class i literally cannot understand people sometimes yesterday we were in class it was the first time seeing our professor since quarantine started in march we all were just talking and then he looked at me and straight up said how much weight do you want to lose at this point you are like a quarter of what you were in the first year i am in my 4th year of high school and i have been struggling with my weight for years are not you going to stop that moment the whole class looked at me i did not even know what to say it was dead silent and i felt so stressed i did not reply and then he changed subject thankfully i am in recovery i still have a long way to go i am gaining some weight back but mentally i am definitely not quite there yet but i am trying my best luckily it did not trigger a relapse or anything so this is good but i do not even want to imagine what i would have done if he addressed my weight when i was still struggling and at the peak of my ed people are so unaware of the effects that their words can have on others and it shows,1,228
my friends have uploaded a snippet of their vlogs from our trip to japan on youtube and i cannot find anything wrong with how i look i know i looked a bit chonky but to see how much fun i was having and how wide i was smiling i do not know it is strange to be okay with my reflection for once,1,63
does anyone has the goal of being naturally skinny like eating big portions of food but somehow being skinny and this how i developed an exercise addiction,1,27
why do you not like being fat do you hate fat people i am so annoyed at constantly hearing stuff like this no i do not hate fat people no i would not treat someone else who was my size at my height this way no i do not hold other fat people to the standards i set for myself just because i hate myself and wish i was thin enough to disappear does not mean i would want for anyone else to do the same why is that so hard to understand,1,93
1200 is not plenty and i am tired of pretending it is i did the math to prove it exactly what the title says this post is targeted towards people in the same circumstances as myself obv everyone is height weight goals are different the 1200 is plenty mentality is driving so many towards eating disordered behavior and i cannot believe so many people advocate for this diet without medical recommendations or approval from a physician the 1200 is plenty movement has given my brain an unrealistic expectation for what weight loss is supposed to be and an unrealistic goal to achieve here is the math i did i am 5 3 and 125lbs my bmr is 1256 calories a day and my tdee with light exercise is 1727 calories per day science says that if i eat at a 500 calorie deficit per day i will lose a pound per week that is 1227 calories a day which is slightly more than 1200 by the way if you are keeping track of the math except last night i started thinking about the numbers why do i need to lose a pound per week i weigh 125lbs and a pound per week is 0 8 of my body weight i am asking my body to lose almost 1 100ths of myself every week when i am not even overweight i do want to lose body fat and tone up but it is not like i am doing it for health reasons at this point in comparison if i weighed 250lbs tdee of 2507 cals day then losing a pound per week would be 0 4 of my body weight half of what i would be asking for at 125lbs so why does our society push this 1200 calories day diet to us why am i asking my normal weight body to work twice as hard to lose this weight as someone who is obese for my height if i scaled back my efforts to match the 0 4 then that is half a pound of weight loss per week not a full pound the numbers are worse when you consider how much of a calorie reduction it is per day at 250lbs a 500 calorie reduction means eating 80 1 of your normal calories per day at 125lbs a 500 calorie reduction means eating 71 of your normal calories per day i am not sure when where our society decided that 1200 day was the goal but it is not sustainable and we are restricting 10 more calories than individuals twice our weight when there is not even a medical reason to do so tl dr 1200 calories a day is a bullshit concept and if you are at a height weight where losing a pound week means eating at 1200 cals day then you probably should not be trying to lose a pound week because it is asking your body to work twice as hard we work 2x as hard and put in all that effort and then wonder why we stress and burn out and end up eating disordered,1,521
found my husbands tik tok him liking videos of girls twerking and commenting on videos giving compliments he never gives me compliments other than you look good and that is fucking rare he commented wow all caps on a girl i knows video he is never told me wow i would literally melt if i got a wow from him it makes me literally sick that i get like no attention he says he is not like that but he can give it to other girls why not me have not ate in two days i am so freakin mad my heart feels like it is dropped to my belly update we had a long talk tonight after we put the kids to bed after a bit of gas lighting mostly do not look through my phone if you do not want to see it i just told him that i would be doing the same things he is and i would see how he liked it i went on tik tok searched hot guys and just started dming them childish i know but it got my point across we had a normal discussion after that where he excepted what i was saying one of his arguments is it is not his fault i am insecure which i told him is silly because he is my husband he is supposed to make me feel secure like wtf but i think i got through to him he is still sticking with his story that it is not his account he showed me his main account but i still think this is one he made to like videos and come back later to see them and that it is his friends it is deleted now which is fishy i know a video it for sure commented on so i know it is deleted and not just changed it is name i overall think the talk went well he says he loves me and he is attracted to me he is not sure how to show it to me more than he already does his main argument is he is a good man he do not cheat on me or do things that a lot of people we know do like what am i supposed to do thank him for not cheating am i supposed to accept emotional cheating because he is not physically cheating i explained how low it makes me feel and things like this make it very hard for me to be intimate because i cannot help but think he is thinking about other women he promised to do better he knows that actions speak louder than words and he would do whatever he could to show me he cares overall the talk went good and i think he actually heard me and understood my hurt and feelings of betrayal,1,480

those fasting obsessed redditors are breaking me i was already on the verge of a relapse when i got some comments not even on a diet sub on how unhealthy it is for me to eat 4 5 times a day i have been in treatment for over six years all my doctors and dietician and therapist agree that i am doing great on my food intake and the grazing style of eating is healthy for me you know the people i should trust to know what is best for my body i eat enough to maintain my current healthy weight and allow for me to exercise and continue growing because i am still in my late teens i eat when i get hungry and i stop when i am full i literally will feel sick eating a meal most people call average because i have messed up my stomach so badly that it thinks i have had a gastric bypass there is no way i could eat enough to maintain my weight while doing if or eating two meals a day and yet now i am feeling guilty and sick for eating a snack when i am so hungry i cannot think i want to go back and smack them over the head with a list of the caloric values of everything i have eaten today and explain how it is fucking normal and i consistently feel sick up to a day or two later if i skip meals but i know they will just quote that guy who fasted for a year and lived wikipedia article and tell me i am promoting obesity fuck them fuck them so hard i ate an extra cheese biscuit today because i wanted it and they tasted good and the fact that i can just eat food that i enjoy is something i worked my butt off for years to achieve i cannot believe they think i am doing something wrong for that,1,331

i think i made someone die from ed i made a friend in uni i had no idea she struggled with ed in the past i never mentioned i have ed either but we had this tradition to go grocery shopping together because we both loved it my ed was peaking back then so i would buy tons of sweets or very healthy food and always tons of diet soda we stopped talking somewhere along the way but today i found out she had committed suicide her sister told me that her seeing my eating habits made her relapse which made her depression come back i froze when i read it and i still have 0 clue how to react to this part of me feels selfish thinking that her sister had no right to tell me this but on the other hand the hand which i really do not want to face just keep questioning if i really just made someone commit a suicide,1,165
when you watch a recovery account have cereal will milk and their milk looks mysteeerrriiously beige and they crop the frame to hide the carton because it is unsweetened almond milk or when they have hot chocolate and it looks like options hot choc recovery accounts in quasi recovery trigger me more than ed content sometimes istg like we are all calorie counters we know you are not eating enough even if to someone who is not a meticulous calorie counter non ed people it looks like you are and everyone is all like go girl in the comments and i am like i eat that much and i am not in recovery hhhhhherhjrtiekjcjkwifjfkejfkcj,1,114

people asking so what have you been up to has made me realize how much my ed has taken over my life same with so what do you do for fun what is been up and so on and its variants when people ask me about my hobbies i cannot think of anything my whole days are occupied by food my weight numbers binging purging wash rinse repeat i can tell you the number of calories that was in my lunch but i cannot tell you what i enjoy watching on netflix or what book i have enjoyed most recently i think the closest thing i have to a hobby is running but that is also just a compulsive ed behavior although a socially acceptable one this shit sucks,1,129
i miss the early stages of my eating disorder where weight would just fall off me and there was that excitement of being able to fit into all these smaller clothes and people told me i looked thin now i just gain and lose the same 3 pounds over and over again for months on end the effects of restriction are beginning to make me feel tired and lethargic and yet there is no pay off anymore i do not get that high off fasting anymore and to be honest i cannot fast at all which makes me feel like a huge failure and like i am not really ill i want to nourish myself properly but i know that the moment i do i will start to gain weight and the thought of that terrifies me because i felt even more disgusting than i do now before all this i feel like i will just be stuck in this fucking limbo forever and it is unbearable,1,167
reminder when most people say i have not eaten today they do not actually mean they have had 0 food or 0 calories that day this is a reminder for myself but also for other people because we all have the same brain on this subreddit my boyfriend came home from work last night he said he was hungry because he had not eaten anything all day which made me feel gross and insecure about having eaten then i remembered that he had a plate of hashbrowns in the morning a latte and some fruit on his lunch break people will snack on food have small meals in between breakfast lunch or lunch dinner and they will not count it as actually eating that day because it is not a normal meal and most people do not count drinks as meals most of the time i have not eaten anything today means i have not sat down at the table and prepared myself a dish and more importantly you are allowed to eat even though someone else has not eaten in front of you this is a reminder to you because i always get so insecure and nervous when people tell me that they have not eaten that day because for some reason my brain does not realize that i get to have food just because it is important to remember that your ed tricks your brain into thinking that it is normal when in fact most people do not think about food calories in such a paralyzing fashion,1,259
you are not allowed to until you are thin does anyone set unrealistic goals about what you are and are not allowed to do until you lose weight like i need to lose redacted pounds before i am allowed to get lash extensions again or have my hair professionally recolored because it would be a waste of money at my current weight,1,62

generic representation of ed on the media starterpack throws away food they have just made on the trash only purge method shown is self induced vomiting using fingers a white skinny girl that actually looks pretty has no personality at all reads magazines probably wears a sweater what they are trying to tell is that she is not eating portrayed as wanting to be pretty,1,65
my roommate confronted me i hate myself my roommate texted me today i am not close to him we share the same space but not friends he texted me to stop throwing out vomit bags into the outside trashcans because they were attracting bugs and rats that no one should have to deal with handling someone else s human waste that if i do it again to just pour it into the toilet next time instead i have never felt so ashamed the reason i b p in my room rather than the bathroom was i wanted to avoid hogging the single bathroom shared by three adults and it is backfired i texted back apologizing saying it will not happen again but knowing him he will not respond and i highly doubt we will ever speak of it in person he is in the right about being upset at me and i feel like shit i was not aware he saw them handled them or that rats were attracted to it no one should have to touch my vomit it is gross naturally i am binging right now because my emotions are going fucking insane will purge despite everything because i need the release i have had so many breaking points none of them matter anymore i do not think i can go into work tomorrow i have not done laundry in a week i hate taking showers now i want to rip myself apart i spent the day with my dad and it was nice but i feel like a fucking liar living a double life i lie and lie and lie i feel like dirty scum,1,278

i do not trust myself to buy nicer clothes because my weight fluctuates so much i had a realisation this morning whilst looking through my wardrobe that i have been telling myself for years that i will buy nice new clothes once my weight is more stable the result is a wardrobe full of clothes that are just okay but the quality is not great and the style is not how i would like it the problem is that my weight goes up and down so frequently that clothes rarely fit me as they should they are either quite baggy or tight fitting does anyone else do this it would help my body image so much if i was in clothes i actually liked but it is hard to justify spending more money on clothes that will only fit me some of the time,1,144
for everyone that is feeling shit about how much they may have eaten today the average person eats over gt  5000  lt calories of food on christmas alone and that is the average so there are heaps more people that ate far more it is okay you will be okay it is just one day take a deep breath and move on i love you all so much we got this edit 500 upvotes holy shit we really are struggling but we are all in this together hey we can so do this,1,93
i am so fucking irritated by how much better i am treated when i am close to being uw tw lots of weight loss mention and experiences being underweight okay so i was slimmish to begin with i have not weighed myself since 2018 ballparking it like mid 120s before i lost this weight and i am 5 7 well i am guessing i have lost about ten pounds because the difference in how i am treated is fucking ridiculous granted i have a small frame so if i am not in shape you can tell but it also means that when i lose weight you can tell pretty quickly too so just now i was going through my old pics and a video from august popped up and i did not even recognize myself i carry so much weight in my face and did not realize but yeah now it is nov and people are so nice to me and it makes sense my friends are nicer too even though ik they do not realize that is why they are doing it i had a friend tell me verbatim yesterday that you look so good recently you are wearing all the same stuff you used to but it is like you are more confident now so everything looks like a whole fit you know like no sweet girl it is not confidence it is because i am about to lose my period and i have nightmares about eating but yeah i was already in the lower end of healthy bmi range before i started restricting again but the difference in how people treat me after going from skinny to skinnier is stupid i am the pretty friend now the she is so tiny does she eat friend i can feel men staring at me who would not have given me the time of day three months ago it is so sad it makes me so sad and now i am sitting on my phone looking at celebrities and realizing that a lot of the time not all but a lot a big chunk of their attractiveness is in part because they are bordering uw i mean fuck even my family is nicer to me when i am skinnier it is so fucked because this is what i wanted and even though i knew before that we subconsciously glorify uw bodies because of what we associate them with etc it kind of sucks to experience how shallow society is firsthand does anyone else relate to this it is such a weird mental state to be in when you know you are where you want to be physically or like 70 80 of the way there and still feel like you did before even though you get compliments and then the compliments the things you wanted so badly make you feel more hollow god i am so tired sorry for this long vent love you all please stay safe,1,498
fucking revelation like many of you i love my 600lb life and dr now i like to picture him telling me i have to eat 800 calorie a day and stick to de plan to lose the weight tirty pount in one munt but today i pictured him saying other things to me today you ate 342 calorie that is too little calorie i tell my 600lb patients to eat more you did not get enough protein today that is why you have headache and feel weak your heart rate dropping again if it gets back into the tirties this is bad situation you 32 years old now you think you going to make it to 40 do you look like you are malnourished yes you do you ate 1500 calorie today i am proud of you you makin good progress this munt oddly inspirational,1,145

you cannot destroy your metabolism for real i know it is a thought that is perfect to descend into this place of dread and self loathing where any amount of calories you eat will make you gain because you destroyed your metabolism but that is not true i cannot stress enough that gaining weight with an under 1000cal intake is pretty much impossible it cannot be done this is not how bodies work your brain needs a shitton if cals even if you have brain fog your heart beats and your intestines work your core will be kept warm for as long as possible no matter how thin or short you are you will need more than a few hundred calories just for being alive tell yourself that when you think you gain on water and half a salad per day then why is the scale telling you otherwise because scales are not great for measuring small fluctuations scales cannot tell you if you lost a fraction of a pound or gained if you weight yourself 3 times you will get three weights water in your body exists food in your intestine exists that all is part of your weight so instead of enjoying those sweet moments of beating up yourself over destroying your metabolism and painting doom scenarios in your head how you can only eat 100cals per day to lose weight focus on how that is a lie your ed is telling you to make you restrict more and hate yourself more,1,254

my bf played in my face so last night i was telling my bf that i see him in my future long term this man says that i am amazing and unique but if he were to get married he would want his wife to have a hot bod and that if he were to get married to me he would want me to get liposuction because he is concerned about my waist and what would happen if we have kids but that he also wishes i was curvier and that his family friend was scared to marry his wife because she had like a saggy neck and my bfs family warned him against marrying her because of that and now the guy regrets marrying her so my bf said he needs to be 100 sure his future wife is hot so he will always be attracted this conversation happened 2 months after i recovered and just managed to start feeling healthy again and not always cold and dizzy and my clothes actually fit again i do not know i kind of want to sell him to the circus so he can be with the clowns i am just shocked someone who said they love me could say something like that and i feel like i am going insane,1,219

calories needed by your organs and why restricting below your bmr is so dangerous each of your organs requires much more energy than you would think i will be posting the calorie demands of each but it will vary 20calories due to genetic size differences liver 200 brain 250 heart 440 kidneys 440 skeletal muscle 13 adipose tissue 5 residual organs and tissuw 12 if you eat below the total you will not live a full life that is absolutely guaranteed and the reason why eating disorders are the deadliest mental illness in fact those with anorexia on average die 20 years after contracting the disease so please for the love of god do not restrict so much you die before you are 30,1,124

do not know if i am an asshole for this but it honestly makes me laugh seeing all these non disordered people talk about eating all day long and gaining the covid 19 the exact same people that always tell others to just stop eating so much and judge people especially with bed for comfort boredom eating are you still as happy to tell me now that it is easy to just stop eating whenever you want still making fun of me for eating emotionally or to pass time where is your properly functioning hunger cues now huh of course it sucks especially for the eating disordered among us but it is pretty funny to me that the people who make fun of me are getting a taste of their own medicine cannot exactly feel any empathy for them,1,139
to the sweet old man who made a comment to me when i was buying binge food to the sweet old man at the donut shop when you saw me carefully select and buy 8 huge donuts you know like the cinnamon roll and apple fritter type donuts and joked at me you must be hungry     if only you knew if only you knew that i had just eaten three pastries at home and rushed over to the closest shopping center from my house breaking the speed limit for these donuts if only you knew that right after i left the shop i would take these donuts to my strategically parked car and eat almost every single one of these by myself and in a single sitting until i was writhing in severe pain so bad that i would not even be able to drive away until my body actually got some time to digest some of the food if only you knew that no i was not just hungry i was fucking famished to drown my agony in donuts even despite the fact that i did the same thing last night as well if you knew you probably would not be laughing at your own joke anymore you would probably be mortified at your own words disgusted at the behavior and sympathetic toward me if only you knew but that is okay you did not know that is why i laughed are your comment too that is why in my eyes you are sweet you probably thought i was taking these donuts to my friends or family talking and laughing in between bites of these pockets of saccharine goodness you probably thought there was no way a 5 2 girl would ever possibly eat all of these on her own maybe if i were 300 lbs you would not have said such a comment but that is okay because from the outside it does not look like i am suffering from an eating disorder so there is no way you could possibly know to the sweet old man at the donut shop i hope you enjoy that single donut that you purchased yourself and remember me as the girl who laughed at your joke and bought donuts to share with others i would not want to burden your day with my issues i want you to remain comfortable enough to continue joking with strangers i do not want you to know edit i cannot believe i got so many compliments on my writing i literally whipped this up randomly and quickly as i was waiting for my food to digest a little before i could drive away from the parking lot after that binge and i was not expecting this kind of response at all i can get a bit insecure about my writing and these comments honestly made me absolutely delighted like maybe i am not such a worthless loser lol  now   if only i could believe people in the same manner when they actually call me pretty or not fat laugh my ass off,1,517

i get mad at all these anti diet culture instagram accounts i really need to stop looking at them because they piss me off their goal is to let people know they can eat whatever they feel like but it just comes off as shaming eating disorder behaviors they always joke about eating 1200 calories every day and how if you do that then on the weekend you will go oh shit i binged now my life is over tell me that is not shaming girls who suffer from an ed they are not acknowledging that it is not that easy to just eat whatever you want and not care also the women running these accounts are skinny they also bash clean eating they say you will just want junk food more when you deny yourself it denying myself junk food has made me hate it you do not know me ugh,1,152

why does the media collectively shame women for not taking care of themselves anymore when it comes to food but never addresses the fact that women were often thinner in the past because of drugs i was just watching someone talk about how brutally difficult it is to watch early 70s 80s 90s shows because of how small the women are and we got on the subject of how processed foods and food additives and food pricing have affected american diets to trend toward unhealthy and over processed fast food but the more we started talking in the more we realized that a lot of the fitness in these generations is derived from cocaine or some crazy prescriptions in addition to the physical exercise and diet trends of the time like hell yeah i would be thin too if i was popping phentermine all day and not drinking at parties because i would rather do coke it kind of feels like i have been cheated out of a cheat code,1,170

my mum bought me an advent calendar with wax melts instead of chocolates i have not had an advent calendar in years and the thought of one scares me i was not expecting one at all until this turned up in the mail today my mum knows about my ed and this is the most perfect advent calendar i could ever wish for what makes it more special is that my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer a few weeks ago and her life is currently so taken over by biopsies mris and injections plus looking after my grandad with alzheimer s which is probably why this was sent so early she is planning christmas stuff before the chemo starts she is just the most thoughtful and kind person ever even when she has so much going on in her own life she is always thinking of others i am a bit overwhelmed by this gesture and wanted to share with people who might appreciate it too lt 3,1,169
this may be a hot take but the liberal usage of pro ana and the removal of some posts hides the reality of eating disorders and makes it harder for a true safe space to exist now i am not saying that posting things like oh use this to reduce your appetite or burn more calories is ever ok that is not ok however what is ok is being completely open and honest about what your experience entails for many of us including myself there is not really anyone in my life who is able to empathize with me they can listen and sympathize but no one around me can genuinely care about the shit i have to deal with when posts that are genuinely trying to express the distress that someone goes through due to their ed whether it be an accidental wrist showing describing a behavior etc then i do not feel like it should be removed i cannot tell you how annoying it is when i am just trying to say hey this is my personal experience with a very individual disease and it gets removed or flocked as being pro ana i do not think anyone actually is trying to encourage the behavior of others in that manner i think we can all agree that eating disorders whether it is typical atypical ana bed ednos etc are something we genuinely hope others engage with i do not know if this is coherent at all but i personally believe that the more open and honest we can be as a community when it involves the reality of such an ugly disease we need a place to vent and the vast majority of venting here is almost never meant to be malicious the human experience needs to be included so that this can be a true safe space rant over,1,312
i literally just saved a kitten from a burning building i just needed to tell someone and this feels like my only real community nowadays laughing out loud delete if not allowed update kitty is back with her family staying at their grandparents house she seems to be doing great fyi for those asking i am doing fine definitely inhaled some smoke but my body seems to have recovered from that pretty well just really tired now,1,77
i was purging in the restaurant bathroom until i realized the whole restaurant could hear me basically i went in the bathroom to purge and after like ten minutes of purging i could hear many people whispering about flu upset stomach i hope the food here is not rotten is the girl in the bathroom okay when i came out literally everyone was staring at me i tried to act all nonchalant and like i had no idea why everyone was looking at me but it kind of failed not going to lie i am such a huge embarrassment,1,99

the problem with intuitive eating is so much food is engineered to be addictive one of the main things they taught me in recovery which caused me to balloon in weight and eventually relapse was to honor you are body and hunger cues and eat intuitively it is a great theory but a vast majority of food is scientifically engineered to be addictive with sugar and chemicals etc these food companies put a lot of resources behind it and it is not an accident it makes it at least for me something i cannot do because my body in a non restrictive state will always want more chips or candy or mcdonald s or whatever it is,1,117
coworker on ozempic really triggering so one of my coworkers is on ozempic and losing weight with it she is been kind of blatantly disordered about her weightloss since before she started ozempic but since starting it is only gotten worse she is also been violently vomiting in the student bathroom that is in my classroom it is not intentional but it is so frequent and all she talks about how much she throws up and how much weight she is losing and how it is so great literally all she talks about is weight and how little she eats and how all she eats is chicken and broccoli and how she cannot even stomach sweets anymore and she does not know how anybody eats all that junk and blah blah blah i know i am responsible for my own triggers but i cannot avoid this woman ugh,1,148
i have been through all stages of having an eating disorder but none of them suck as much as binging constantly the mental and physical drain of being full all the time the pain in you are stomach isolation because you feel self conscious and having no track of time because you are body is on autopilot and you cannot seem to snap out of it goddamn you got to be stronger than the marines to survive an ed,1,79

i got a boyfriend and he makes me feel small i am weight restored as of last year after losing my period for 1 5 2 years i am actually right in the middle of my bmi bracket and i have never weighed this much i was desperately trying to drop weight before he touched me or picked me up but he is really super strong tall and he has realllllllly big hands for some reason like his hands can almost wrap around my waist it is crazy he makes me feel so tiny and light he picked me up today and twirled me around without difficulty i guess i do not have to drop weight immediately after all lol relapse averted edit holy heck i did not expect this to get attention and awards but thanks for everyone who commented and awarded i hope i motivated you all to recover a lil more today,1,155
does anyone else feel like they need to be thinner to fit their style aesthetic i am very into fashions like himekaji gyaru nymphet and i just feel like i cannot wear these styles without being super thin i am smack dab in the middle of the healthy bmi range right now 21 5 and i do wear these fashions but i cannot help feeling out of place and giant i feel like i need to be underweight to truly fit my aesthetic i just want to be small and tiny and light i do not want to be this big flabby pig anymore c full disclosure that if you have my bmi you are not fat by any means if i saw anyone in real life with my bmi i would probably think they are skinnier than me lmao as you all know body dysmorphia distorts the way i view myself alone and i mistakingly am convinced that i look fat at a weight that normal people look perfectly good slim at,1,173

this corona shit is making my food might not be there later so i have to eat as much of it as possible right now because i will not know when the next time i will be able to eat it feeling skyrocket everyone buying literally everything is making my anxiety go crazy i do not want to go outside to buy anything anymore i been feeling so triggered the past two to three days feeling like i am going to binge because of all the panic buying people are doing i am also trying to save money right now so i do not want to go buy a bunch a stuff and my partner eats so much fucking food in one day it is stressing me out like we are going to run out of food and i feel like my periods going to start soon and i have been cooped up with my 3 year old inside all day today and they have been really energetic and i am just very stressed out i feel nauseous and want to cry,1,182
raise your hand if you ever felt personally victimized by target s self checkout security cameras like i knew i looked like a hot mess but those angles definitely did not help my body dysmorphia on the plus side i got a new set of pens i am dying to try out,1,52
anybody else feel like they are in between ed and normal eating like i have been purposely consuming triggering content for a while now simply because i am tired of being borderline ed lol i cannot remember the last time i ate and did not feel guilty afterwards definitely some years but i keep eating and then feeling guilty i would rather go back to restricting and feeling that rush of doing well restricting than to hate myself every time i eat or worry about the calories i guess either way is kind of disordered though lmao i am tired,1,100

old people stop commenting on my food in grocery stores please this has happened to me twice within a two week span now and i am going to go feral going grocery shopping is stressful enough already without other people making unsolicited comments the first time i was in the ice cream aisle trying to see what halo top flavors there were and an old man walked past me and said that stuff will make you fat you know okay i did not know what to do so i just laughed it off and said haha that is why i am looking at the low cal ones because i felt the need to justify my actions to this complete stranger i think he realized that i was not taking it well because he backtracked really quickly and was like i am just kidding you are looking very beautiful today and then went off on a tangent about how he is the one who eats all of the ice cream in his house he seemed harmless so even though it bothered me i moved on i got out of that aisle quick though and i definitely could not get ice cream after hearing that then today i was doing my weekly shopping and just buying my normal groceries while i was doing self checkout an old woman who worked at the store side eyed my cart and went that is a lot of food and the way she said it honestly made my skin crawl it was so condescending and unnecessary and just make me feel ashamed even though it was not a lot of food and i know that it is not enough to even make me maintain if i were to eat it all in a week so that comment just came out of absolutely nowhere i would just really love it if i could buy food without strangers making me feel guilty about it i think i do enough of that on my own,1,336

i turned my parents into pumpkin farmers i am visiting home this summer after living abroad for five years kabocha japanese pumpkin has become one of my favorite safe foods i get one every week i would live on kabochas alone if i could and they do not exist at home such was the elaborate panic attack i had yesterday over the phone to my parents there were tears there was a failed plan to put some in a suitcase i thought i would just have to make peace with it all but then i woke up this morning to the news that they have sourced kabocha seeds  and all the equipment one could ever need to grow them and planted five in the yard my father even prepared a little paintbrush to pollinate them they are sending progress pictures the harvest is set for the week i land the world is a less scary place and my family have the patience of heroes,1,164

how are thin celebs not underweight how do we let this fly under the radar my bmi is like gt  16 5  lt and honestly i just saw some pics of emily ratagkekxcjv whatever the f her name is showing how she bouced back from pregnancy and honestly i only look as thin as her with my morning skinni so what tf there is no way she is a healthy weight she is not the only celeb that is this size but we all just accept that its a normal size someone can healthily achieve how how how how it makes no sense to me were just letting underweight fly under the radar and acting like its normal and its fucked up and there is no way it all comes down to body fat and muscle weighs more blah blah blah i have been working a pretty darn physically demanding job for a bit so i am not just skinny fat especially since if those women were just all muscle they would be a lot sinewy er and less perfectly smooth,1,181

i am so tired of being ugly i am just so tired i am so tired of being ugly it is all i think about all the time i wish i did not care i know logically that beauty standards are bullshit constructed by a patriarchal consumerist racist eurocentric fatphobic classist paradigm i know there is no such thing as ugliness i know the way anyone looks does not matter in the slightest no person is ugly no girl is ugly if anyone told me they thought i was ugly i would think they were wrong for subscribing to such a paradigm if a person came to me and told me they were ugly i would be devastated i do not look at anyone and think that their looks deem them in any way less worthy of love and no one else should either if someone is ugly by societal beauty standards it is okay they are no less worthy of love or acceptance or kindness or value and yet it is just me and to me that does not apply i am ugly and my ugliness makes me worthless and my ugliness makes me ashamed i am just really tired i am tired of looking like this no one ever told me it was okay to look the way i look and i know if i were to change everything about how i look i still would not be happy because logically it is not about the way i look at all and it is tiring because you cannot be ugly in peace y know you are constantly reminded you are ugly and when you tell friends that you know you are objectively ugly the response is often no you are so pretty and it is a double edged sword really because they are only trying to be nice and it is nice but it does remind you that you cannot just be ugly and have it be okay no one can really say yeah you are ugly but so what it does not matter because we all know very well that it does matter very much i am just tired existing is exhausting the corporeal experience is exhausting the interpersonal nature of life is exhausting i do not want to be ugly anymore,1,385

i watched a ballerinas what i eat in a day video tw fdoe calorie counting so i just watched a ballerinas fdoe on youtube n the comment section was full of praises for her eating habit saying how great it is that she is eating whole meals n how she has a good relationship with food but well the whole time i was watching my ed brain was also counting all the calories she was consuming and while they are healthy food items i am dead sure that there is no way she ate more than 1400kcal in itself that amount is not that little but the fact that she is having 8 10 hour of dance rehearsal everyday plus commute while only eating that much is rather concerning and the fact that people were praising her for this is just wow it would have triggered me if i was not too baffled from it,1,155

i am going to do the anorexia but also somehow be nice to myself and have a good life this time anyone else start a relapse thinking like this laughing out loud,1,32
does anyone else eat very little in the morning and afternoon and then binge like a mother fucker at night because same today i was doing so well i ate a protein bar a few crackers and a little bit of my dinner i was so happy and my body felt great as i was becoming less bloated from my binge yesterday but than i sat down to watch the new south park episode which was funny as usual and literally ate three poptarts i feel so gross and like a failure i wish i could stop binging back in february i was restricting and purging with ease and i got down to my lowest weight but after a suicide attempt i began to binge and i stopped purging so i would not damage my singing voice i have periods of restriction but only for a week at most i have not gained much weight 11 lbs due to having a fast metabolism but i feel so fucking worthless,1,169
how do people in the fasting community do it these motherfuckers are going over a week without eating and they are so chill about it you all do not feel like you are fucking dying after 2 days of no food my body feels like it is shutting down and these bitches are going a monthhhhhhh i do not understand,1,60
models and their obligatory relatability with food i feel like i have watched the same vogue videos over and over again on youtube i have been watching models like suki waterhouse and gigi hadid have a camera follow them around as they get ready for a show they are gorgeous stunning from the way they speak to the way they carry themselves i almost watch these videos to force myself to learn from them on how to behave when i reach my ugw how to act like a skinny girl but i noticed a pattern within the format these videos go by and this includes the obligatory junk food moment as the girls search for a meal to eat it will be a big greasy burger with cheese and pickles or salted fries that get me bloated just looking at them or perhaps even a hearty breakfast filled with sugar and butter and whipped cream and god it just makes me feel like absolute shit because i panic immediately why do they feel the need to make sure their audience know they eat so terribly why do they have the desire to convince everyone that they are just like us i feel like it is almost mocking me as the viewer as if they are making fun of me because here i am starving myself daily just so i could look like them while they reassure me that i am doing it for nothing that i am just not blessed with what they are blessed with that my body is made from just a different material like dirt while theirs are made of gold and diamonds it is just really so hard to tell myself i will be on their level when i feel like i am sinking deeper into the ground everyday,1,303

i feel like i cannot openly talk about many of my ed related feelings anywhere because a broader and broader spectrum of things are deemed fat shaming as someone who is been obese i get it fat shaming feels awful and is awful but does anyone else feel like they are walking on egg shells when they talk about certain ed related thoughts and feelings because saying anything remotely negative about fatness is automatically fat shaming for gods sakes the other day i said something in a facebook support group about part of my ed stemming from a fear of getting fat again because my body simply started breaking down at a certain weight because almost no one with my frame can handle being over 200lbs without physical consequences everyone jumped down my throat and told me i was a fat hating bigot preoccupation and worrying about fatness is part of my ed but i guess i will just never talk about it maybe i am just over sensitive right now but it feels like you get screamed at and deleted if you so much as sneeze in a way that sounds like word obese in an ed community,1,199
seeing thin people in the real world maybe nsfw this is going to make me sound like the most chronically online human possible but seeing super thin people especially girls out and about has got to be the shittiest feeling ever i was working one day and this girl prob no older than 17 came in with her parents and when i say this girl was skinny her thigh gap was at least 3 inches wide she also got the lowest calorie item on the menu and an apple for her side it hurts because as a disordered person you feel for people like this because you know they are going through something but at the same time it is like i wish i could be you it feels so morally wrong,1,132
my friend was bullying a coworker for her weight and i told her off i am not at all confrontational so i am very happy with myself i have a younger coworker who has been feeling self conscious about her weight lately she is well above average regarding looks so it is a bit upsetting to me actually after hearing that she wanted to loose weight my friend also a coworker started making some really insensitive comments she was straight up calling our coworker fat and criticizing her for eating after she made my coworker cry i got angry and then she said something again and i fucking snapped i told her that she was being incredibly cruel for no reason she asked why everyone was in such a shitty mood and could not take a joke and i replied that she was putting us in a shitty mood by being a bitch now this may seem like a pretty benign thing but you have to understand that i am a coward i have never stood up for anyone other then meekly asking to change the topic i am still shaking and this was over 3 hours ago i think i lost a friend today i am damn happy about it because how dare she though seriously good riddance she was pissed off and for the first time in my life i do not care that someone is mad at me i am pretty proud of that edit oh my god thank you so much for all of the niceness i have been feeling pretty shitty the past few days so it really brightened my week,1,276
if your s o fetishized your eating disorder you are not alone basically title my ex was definitely enabling and definitely fetishized my eating disorder saying shit like i am so happy you do not eat it makes you look so blank or when we would go to restaurants he would literally order me a salad and not let me get shit myself he was a fitness guy and was all about being a couple that goes running together and shit and that is fine and all but he would literally say come on you have to burn off the calories you ate for lunch and sometimes after just lying in the bed after we did our thing he would trace my collarbones or some other bony part of me and say some really disgusting shit and yes he knew i had an ed and i think that was the worst decision i ever made because he only was bolder with what he would say and do and then when i told him i was trying to recover he actively tried talking me out of it anyways i am glad that nasty man is out of my life,1,198
came across some terrifying meanspo online that i cannot stop thinking about i am not going to type it out for obvious reasons but basically it said to run through knee pain because passing out and being in agony is better than being heavy and i just i cannot do this shit i did that to myself because i believed the same thing and i destroyed my knees in about a week i could not walk properly for almost three months it required physical therapy and still hurts to this day tendon injuries do not heal well and if you injure a joint the damage can last a lifetime please please please do not do this to yourself nothing is worth that amount of pain i want so badly to reach out to the person who posted it because i do not want them to hurt themself but i know it likely will not do any good i understand that they are likely unwell themself but i am still frustrated that they put it out there for people struggling to see tldr do not run through pain if you are in pain please give your body rest you deserve to feel healthy and strong and nothing is worth risking a permanent injury,1,212
whelp i think i am dying hi guys hope you are doing well i am bulimic and have been since i am nine years old i am thirty four now and i have been falling off the deep end now my heart is racing like it never had before and it is irregular as hell i try to convince myself it is just a panic attack but i am terrified that this is it if not today then soon take care of yourselves and try not to fuck up as much as i am sending you all my love and fuck this disease update i had a micro stroke most likely caused by arrhythmia the ekg was normal by the time i saw someone though they let me go with blood thinners scariest shit ever i could not talk normally i am ok now just tired thank you everyone for your support,1,152
he says he wants me to gain weight but he loves me thin he says that i should keep eating well to gain weight to make my butt bigger to get healthier but he loves feeling my ribcage he loves touching my hip bones he loves measuring my wrists and arms with his fingers he loves to make playful jokes about my belly fat when i actually put on weight he likes me thin and i can tell the dissonance drives me insane no i cannot grow only my ass and remain the same elsewhere you fucker thanks for letting me know that my butt is not good enough for you though i really needed to be reminded that i have a flat ass this are not build a bitch and you are old enough to know it,1,138
ed logic is being too scared to order a mocha from starbucks because of the calories then binging on a pack of oreos later that night it infuriates me to no end that instead of just treating myself and getting a mocha i deprive myself and end up binging on five times more calories only to feel like shit after i did not sign up for this and i want my time and money back,1,75
i told my boyfriend some of the more irrational thoughts behind my ed and he just said thank you for trusting me and gave me lots of hugs and kisses i have never had this experience before they have always responded with something hurtful in the past,1,47

eating is not the hard part it is not eating that is impossible i feel like this is all fake because of the fact that i cannot just not eat i used to be really fucking good at this like really good and suddenly i am the antithesis of everything i ever used to be i cannot not eat eating is the easy part after that first bite i am ravenous and i want to continue to eat it is impossible to stop the moment i take a single bite i miss being afraid of it i miss being afraid of taking a bite at all i used to be so excellent i could fast and i could eat minuscule amounts and i could burn calories like no one s business i am incapable of it all now i am huge and there is nothing i am doing about it i know exactly how to get to where i was but i cannot god i just want to be irrevocably triggered and get back on the wagon who am i,1,180
to the petite moms who decided to procreate with giants i am 5 8 and literally fucking underweight right now 120 lbs and my asian mom who is like 5 1 that bitch has the nerve to tell me oh even when i gave birth to you i never exceeded 100 pounds hurr durrr bitch i am 7 inches taller than you tf and i am supposed to weigh less than 100 pounds maybe you should have thought about that before procreating with a 6 7 caucasian man built like a damn linebacker with broad shoulders it is annoying but i like my height to be honest since i can look skinnier way faster and easier and hello bella hadid is the same height but bruh and do not even get me started when i was not uw even at a normal weight my mom told me i looked like a mom who gave birth to five babies i looked trash and unkept and my thighs were humongous i was 135 pound at 5 8 miss girl and when i told her i was 135 at the time she gave a scandalized gasp like bruh weight standards for tall girls are different,1,202
there is at least one person out there who cares about me i was waiting in line at my university today to get food the first meal i had eaten in 2 days i have a take home container because i do not have any friends to sit with so i usually eat in my room i walked by the desert as i usually do eyeing it up but not grabbing any as i walked by the desert a kind old cafeteria lady asked me you do not ever eat desert do you i looked up her and awkwardly went no i do not but it would not fit in my container anyway and the lady boxed up a small piece of cake for me and handed it to me and said you do not have to eat this but you should it is really yummy i went back to my room after that and cried i have not had someone be kind to me like that in a long time i am happy to say i ate almost my entire dinner and the piece of cake,1,187
anyone else have no other interests besides food and dieting these days lately i feel like i just wake up eat my oatmeal listen to nutrition podcasts bookmark recipes i will either never make or be too afraid to eat when i do make read books like anti diet by christy harrison and agree with everything she says while still restricting think about food plan meals and grocery trips workout excessively cuz i am bored and finish the day off with some mukbang or what i eat in a day youtube videos when tf did i become so boring laugh my ass off,1,103
any body else ignore people who comment on their own weight when i am minding my business and they go oh i am so fat i just pretend i do not hear it i do not have the mental capacity to deal with that and how bad i feel about my own body all the time i do not need people sending me their lt underweight gt bmi and telling me that they are so fat ugh i hate when people tell me that i am lucky to be thin cuz i am asian well sorry i am not naturally thin i had to starve myself to get underweight and it is still not as underweight as other asians naturally are,1,121
anorexia has entered the chat i have a new roommate who just moved in she casually mentioned she does not eat dinner ever now i am usually very recovery minded extremely so but as soon as she said this my brain flipped a switch and a familiar voice was like oh you think you do not eat a lot we will see who does not eat a lot like why am i like this a very nice friendly girl moves in and my brain was like now you are in an imaginary competition with her have fun,1,97
secretly proud is anyone ever secretly proud of the how much they have restricted how little they have eaten and so on etc i will never admit it to anybody and i know i should feel ashamed for my pride but i get so proud of myself when i reach my goals i feel like this pride is getting in the way of me getting help,1,66
fuck body standards skinny was and still is clearly the hype for years however curvier women are being more appreciated now which do not get me wrong is great but in a way it is not different at all people say they like thick women but what they really mean is tiny waist and skinny everything except for boobs and butt this body ideal is even harder to achieve in my opinion because you cannot get it through just dieting it is arguable that no amount of exercise can help you get it either it is mostly just good genetics then with an actual thick girl she will be called fat and be told to lose weight it is ridiculous and a skinny girl will be called flat and told to eat a burger it is exhausting that body standards do not cater to majority of the population and most likely never will,1,153
this fucking quarantine is the worst i was going so fucking well i was organized and not feeling so bad about food i was keeping myself under control and then bang this fycking quarantine happened and now it is hard not to binge every fucking day and ugh i feel so bad and so gross and i think i gained a lot of weight and ughh really i feel like a fucking piece of shit and i do not know how to stop it because the fridge is full and it is so hard to stay distracted and ugghhg i just do not know what to do sorry for the vent by the way hope you all are doing great lt 3,1,122
i feel like pulling my hair out whenever i see fitness influencers talk about how they got shredded by changing their mindset and listening to their body i used to be super restrictive and unhappy and unfit but then i changed my mindset and now i am so skinny and toned like please you did not get 10 body fat by eating what you want if you changed your mindset you changed it into a disordered one please do not deceive your audience like that and make people think you can eat anything and get an insane body i saw an influencer who insists she just listens to her body and eats intuitively and does not track what she eats but at the same time she sells a meal plan of her weekly meals and macros what a joke edit i do not know why this post keeps reaching people who are not regular ed reddit users but if you did not know this is a space for people with active eating disorders and as happy as i am for you that you got your dream body by being happy that is just not in the cards for a lot of us this post is meant as a rant not a request for advice,1,214
restrictive ed weight loss expectations vs reality shitpost expectations pretty skeleton comfort prettier able to live my life fully flat stomach confidence reality thinking about it all the time fuck i messed up now i will devour the fridge every part gets thinner while the stomach becomes a balloon that is very close to pop getting diagnosed with deficiencies by everyone around you my brain saying it is time to get funky when i pace around a room too scared to shower because i do not want to see my body stomach gases burps and farts go brrr do you want to have diarrhea or constipation yes always feel like vomiting and keep puking a little randomly at times sluggish my heart  i am speed sodium says goodbye clothes are now rather curtains or trash bags in me rings that keep falling off my fingers bath worth of water gatherings is how i disappear,1,154
i am so glad i have been forcefully admitted to hospital this morning my mental health team sent me to hospital due to my lack of compliance with the weight restoration and refeeding independently i never thought i would say this but i am so fucking glad they did i get to finally speak with a dietitian in the morning and not only that but i feel like i finally have permission to recover as much as the ed wants the control and is screaming at me about it the logical side of my brain is so pleased i am so exhausted having to constantly live up to the eating disorder s expectations and to be a slave to her i am so happy i get a break and to just sit back and let other people carry the recovery for me for a couple of days weeks that was all i just wanted to share this with the community who has bought me so much strength and reason to recover these past few months the journey from here will be hard but i have never been more relieved and free from the ed i hope you all too can one day find a path to recovery take care all,1,210
in defense of broad shoulders i see so many people on here saying they wish they had narrow dainty shoulders but my wide square shoulders are a trait i have always really liked about my appearance so here are some reasons to feel good about them proportionally waist seems narrower they make me look like i have really good posture which in turn makes me look more confident than i am wide shoulders long elegant collarbones i am going to arms look really nice coming down at 90 s from shoulders instead of sloping out straps amp purses never fall off get a life gadot s wonder woman shoulders anyways hope that gives a few of you with this slightly controversial bone structure something new to like,1,127
i wonder why i am so cold url thumbnail images,1,10
i love high restricting you are telling me i get to lose weight and still have energy to exercise and focus in class and do my silly little tasks you are telling me i get to eat and lose weight and not totally sacrifice my sanity also the results are so satisfying and consistent i just i know people complain that it is slower but for me it is not because when i restrict too low i binge and fuck up my weekly average calories laugh my ass off,1,89
some fat activists scare me out of recovery apologies in advance if this is a controversial opinion i really do feel bad about saying this but like seeing people who are 400 pounds and insisting that they love their bodies i mean yay for them honestly not dragging them down on this and that they are healthy ummm no honestly just scares me if i stop restricting am i going to end up like that because it seems to me that those people are trapped in obese bodies and instead of trying to get out they are now just accepting their fate and trying to make the best of it these people are honestly having the opposite effect on me that they intend to have they make me accept larger people even less and make me scared to stop restricting because i do not want to end up how they are i keep trying to tell myself that i have never been anywhere close to overweight before so it is very unlikely that i will intuitively eat my way up there and that i am working with a registered dietician who insists that i am still not eating enough and not fully weight restored and i do trust that she would stop me before i got overweight but some of these people just give me massive anxiety,1,227
i hate that the longer i go without eating the better my body looks and i hate that when i get worse mentally and get skinnier people will notice and praise me for it like it is some kind of thing to be proud of for not feeding your own body,1,51
if caffeine is an appetite suppressant why am i still hungry hmm four cups of coffee and i still want lunch seems like a scam,1,25
i know the whole i feel pretty when i do not eat is very early 2000 s tumblr proana but i legitimately feel that way also my bathroom smells like vomit it has been six hours and it is not going away,1,42
goodbye thank you it is been a hell of a relapse i have never been as ill as i am now but tomorrow morning i have an appointment with my university s clinic then i have a video appointment with my dietitian then my family is coming to visit i told them everything they are going to help me recover this has to be it i do not have another choice if i do not recover now i might as well die i need to do this once and for all so i am leaving i have been around since the old sub this community has gotten me through the worst of times i cannot express how much i care for each and every one of you i truly hope that one day you all find your ways to recovery please take care with love you cinnamonbicycle edit my gosh guys i am overwhelmed by all the sweet comments and well wishes i wish i could reply to each of you and start up a conversation and get to know everyone here individually i am so so touched by the overwhelming love and support from all you beautiful people my appointment with the clinic is in 15 minutes i want to thank everyone one last time i genuine deeply truly hope that you you specifically reading this find your way to recovery and freedom in due time even if i am not around the sub i will be rooting for you i love you all so much,1,257
the normalization of disordered eating makes me feel invalid af diet communities and diet culture trigger me so much some dieters do shit that is even more extreme disordered than me when my ed was bad and it is somehow seen as normal or encouraged by many people some stuff they say is straight up pro ana laughing out loud makes me feel like it is normal to restrict and compensate and have food guilt and that i am just being silly and melodramatic for trying to recover,1,88
skinny people should not be blamed for triggering people yo hear me out i are not talking about these people who make it their content to bodycheck no i came across a reel of a slim girl in her new years dress and she was feeling herself and the top comment said people like you make me want to kms like is she supposed to feel quilty for a problem you have i am sorry you do not feel good in your body and get triggered by such content but why make it her problem,1,95
what i eat in a day as a girl who eats whatever she wants and then what she wants conveniently fits into deficit maintenance at best girly the fact that non disordered people are fooled and think restriction 1 rice cake and a glass of water does not mean the rest of us cannot clock high res,1,57
please eat drink before the vaccine if you are getting it or you might black out totally not speaking from experience i generally eat pretty regularly but was just in a rush and forgot bad idea it felt awful i am pretty sure i saw god p s god told me that we all looked really skinny,1,57
fucking sick of the ads for fasting applications on reddit i do not know if the reddit application has targeted ads and i just get them because i am on subs like this one and diettea but they make me so mad i feel like i am on the edge of a relapse and it makes me so sad to think of people doing this to themselves willingly there is not even a do not show me ads like this option so i cannot get away from them i even tried blocking the user and reporting but it does nothing,1,100
i hate zoom you know what is great for body dysmorphia and already hating your face having to stare at it on an unflattering screen for 4 hours while you teach and knowing that everyone else on zoom is staring at your face too,1,44
i feel like my disordered eating habits are fake because i can kind of switch it off i can eat normally for a long ass time and then all of a sudden i just fucking go full ed mode and become scared of all food and i eat nothing and fast all the time and this can go on for a while before i just kind of turn it off and then rinse and repeat,1,75
i have a thirteen year old eating disorder happy ana versary to everyone who made a new years resolution in middle school to lose 10 pounds and whose life development has been stagnant since the great recession,1,37
do you have a baby at home it finally happened i am at walmart buying my weekly assortment of fiber supplements no carb energy drinks and gerber puffs crunchies when the cashier asks me if i have a baby at home i almost lied and then i realized this white haired gent is a grandpa he is not calling me fat he just wants to talk babies so i told the truth or a version of it i said they are for me that my husband eats a lot of cereal and chips but i have a sugar problem so i cannot and these help me be not envious and they taste really good you guys he said he is going to try them if everyone starts eating them then no one will notice us buying them o,1,138

oh my god i knew it they do not eat tw drugs alcohol my friend went on a bachelorette party in la we are from a bumpkin town so it is a big deal and everyone at the party were actual models so thin and blonde and their daddies owned huge mansions blah blah blah anyways it was a 4 day bender and they did not eat the whole time the whole time let that sink in half the girls were normal and really choked at the food situation but the other half just took xanax diet pills laxatives and so on the whole time all while being super drunk so it is how they do it it is so annoying because you creep their profile and it is classy restaurants and pictures of pastas and drinks and you are like it is not real they do not eat it,1,150
anyone else absolutely shitting their pants about the incoming balletcore trend so i am a longish time recovered nearly four years sans a few little blips and fairly good at managing my own triggers but the thought of seeing thin girls all over tik tok and social media in leg warmers and leotards looking all delicate and dancery scares the shit out of me ballet dancers were and still are my unrealistic body ideal and i am not ready to see that subliminally and directly pushed mainstream it is going to be much harder to avoid edit oh wow i did not know this would be so relatable current thoughts are to delete tik tok and cancel my order for leg warmers,1,122
made an ed joke while getting a tattoo so i was at my tattoo shop last week getting a small one done and my artist and a few other people were talking about how they do not get how people can throw up and not be loud amp how weird silent pukers are and i just went i can puke quiet but that is only because of the eating disorder and the whole shop just kind of went dead i am amused by how uncomfy everyone became laugh my ass off,1,91
if i see anyone licking ice cream in a grocery store i am going to punch them in the face also a walmart employee made me cry long story short i wanted a tasty frozen treat i was going to get a very low calorie pint of essentially flavorless frozen vegan substance so i went to the frozens section in walmart and lo and fucking behold it is fucking locked because of these bastards doing that ice cream licking challenge i had to ask a fucking employee to open the thing up for me so i already feel hella vulnerable because i am interacting with another human being in the context of food and what does this fucker do i get my low calorie depression pint and this fucker rolls his eyes and says of course before locking the thing back i had to forgo all of the rest of my grocery list and check out immediately so i could get to my car before i started crying so basically if any of you fuckers do that lick the ice cream and put it back in the freezer challenge i am going to come to your house and kick your ass,1,201
when did skinny become average and when did average become chubby i am in pain,1,15
wow that was delicious excuse me a moment while i go and uneat it also thank you so much for dinner i can tell you worked hard on it i am now going to deposit it into your toilet,1,39
i am bigger than my mom now and she loves it my mom has always brought up my weight even before i was too young to understand it she expressed jealousy at my size from the time i was in elementary school to last year when i turned 23 covid took a toll on me and i drank a lot and when i tried to stop drinking i would eat a lot that all took a toll on my weight and my mental health so i am bigger than i have ever been in my life she knows i have struggled with an ed since i was 13 but now that i weigh more she makes a point to remind me she tried on my skirt yesterday and said something like wow i remember when you were so tiny now your clothes are too big for me and just today after i told her i was uncomfortable going to pools or the lake because of my body she sent me pictures of herself in a bathing suit saying you just need to work out and eat right like me sorry if i am rambling or if this sounds stupid but i have never seen her happier than she has been since i gained weight i really do not think that is the right way to treat your daughter i am not sure if i am being irrational and sensitive though edit wow i did not expect so much love and support you are all such beautiful people and i am so sorry that so many of you can relate i love all of you and you have made me feel a lot less alone thank you all so much lt 3,1,291
men are infuriating i hate how they will simultaneously say things like eat more you are so skinny and then later that same day with their hands wrapped around my waist you have visible abs it is hot it is like they think i am disordered so they pressure me to eat while also praising me for being so skinny it is so triggering for me went 5 days successfully low restricting and broke it today because of this i used to like when people mentioned my weight loss but lately it just makes me feel worse,1,97
confirmation yup i am pregnant i am having a baby and it is not a food baby this time and i am eating okay and i am supported by people that love me this is okay i think i am actually excited nervous but excited,1,45
today on the clown diaries i was putting away toilet paper and by muscle memory i tried to look at the nutritional information of the fucking toilet paper,1,28
does anyone else feel pressure to eat the food in their house to get rid of it i will explain my mom is really into buying large quantities of food and freezing it so we have some on hand except we never really run out of this on hand food because she just keeps buying more we also of course buy lots of fresh foods that expire quickly so they need to be eaten relatively quickly so does anyone else feel this pressure to go through food in your house to avoid wasting it i know realistically it is not my responsibility to eat these items and put them to use so to speak but i feel so much internal pressure to make them go away and use them up because i hate wasting food even the frozen stuff i get so worked up thinking about it honestly,1,148
fuck reddit this is stupid af but one of the things i do not do anymore is deprive myself of real bread glance over to a nice post on redacted with some peanut butter and blueberries on nice healthy bread what do i see in the comments too many calories for my waif ass if real bread even touches me my asshole will fall out of my body i am exaggerating but the comment was about using diet calorie bread and trading out the pb for powder all to save x number of calories and guess what i was thinking of how nice it would be to have this food and now i am not allowed to eat real bread anymore fuck people who ed talk in general subs and put down food i have worked for years to eat and fuck my brain too for immediately deciding real bread is no longer allowed because why the fuck should i have nice things fuck reddit and its absurdly pro ed behavior on diet and health subreddits while it straight up bans our safe spaces to talk about our disorders fuck people who see a regular healthy fun meal in what is supposed to be a less restrictive redacted tear the meal apart and shit on it fuck people who do not realize some people are there to fucking recover and do not need their toxic bullshit i fucking hate that diet bread too oh well,1,245
coke zero and low calorie squash a cautionary tale so i was drinking about ten or fifteen litres of coke zero and low calorie squash a day no big deal right no calories no problem well anyways i had a fucking seizure when they ran my bloods in the hospital they found i had stupidly low sodium levels from consuming so much liquid and they think that caused the seizure so anyways now i am back to drinking liquid in moderation and having three square meals a day because fuck it my health is actually important,1,96
ed logic not eating a lean cuisine because it is too many calories then binging on an entire sleeve of girl scout cookies ironically thin mints instead whelp,1,28

does anyone else have sudden bursts of omg this disorder is so stupid i am just going to eat normally followed by eating a relatively normal meal snack then a few minutes later extreme guilt and regret leading you to purge in some way and go straight back to restricting i do not feel like i particularly binge it is just a case of i decide i want to recover and realise i am being stupid eat like a normal person regret it and run for ages to burn it all off,1,92
god please send another greasy white boy my way and have him break my heart so i can effortlessly lose weight again thanks when i got dumped last year i completely lost my appetite and basically just ingested vodka for 3 months and i lost so much weight without even trying i looked amazing in my eyes but super unhealthy in everybody else s and i was also extremely unhappy and could not even enjoy being skinny now i am back to my normal weight and am trying so hard to get back to my sad gorl weight but it is impossible because my heart is not broken anymore and a bitch is hungry haalppppp i am so frustrated,1,119
just saw a picture of myself from the side wish i had not,1,13

you never really appreciated pooping today i learned you develop an ed not really a super long story here i just learned   never take poops for granted i am literally in a perpetual state of constipation that i do not know how to fix just late night thoughts,1,48
got caught reading labels by a shop assistant was scanning aldi s protein yoghurts and checking for the nutritional info when the shop assistant next to me said i am just wondering why you are reading the label so much it is just a dessert you should be able to have it static screen appeared in my brain but then cleared for me to formulate an excuse that was not too far from the truth oh i am lactose intolerance so just checking to see if they put lactase enzymes in so that i can have it proceed to me giving a talk for 5 mins on what that means as he had no clue friendly chap but i have never felt more exposed,1,124
forget the thigh gap bitch i have got a fucking ass cheek gap if all of the other terrible side effects symptoms of having an ed have not put you off then the fact that your ass will literally disappear due to muscle deterioration and you will be left with a grand canyon between yes cheeks is probably what will push you to recovery,1,64
pregnancy is one of my worst fears although i am lesbian and do not plan on having children anytime soon the fact that my body is still able to grow a tiny human inside me is terrifying i am irrationally scared of getting raped never have and if that would ever happen and lead to a pregnancy i would either abort the foetus or kill myself if that were not possible i see pregnancy as some permanent kind of damage to your body you get fatter in an uncontrollable rate it is hard to exercise and you basically rip your genitals afterwards you are left with a little baby that you have to take care of and give up yourself as a priority i could never do that the baby itself puts too much restrictions on your life the aftermath would be unbearable i am just ranting,1,147
i will beat up anyone who makes fun of your safefood figuratively but really i will scold the hell out of them take your competitive ass out of here there are no dumb safe foods some people actually make fun of bananas and apples and i cannot comprehend the stupidity to mock someone having fruit as a safe food you know what else is fine bread oats pizza cheese anything you know why a safe food that satisfies your cravings will make you less likely to binge it is smart to eat something you know will satisfy you for real i hate anyone who tries to be coy or cocky with their i would never eat that safefood or why do people even have as a safefood posts does anyone remember that one meme on edanonymemes with the title is a bad safe food sorry what kind of pathetic bitch goes out of their way to make a post that completely tears apart a common safe food say it is dense in calories make fun of anyone who enjoys eating it and then post it online to a community of people with ed s how insecure are you to do that if you need to tear someone else down to feel tall you must not be very tall to begin with mind you that is coming from someone who is 4 10 i randomly got worked up about this because i began to think what if the person who is going around sending hate pm s is one of the catty competitive users on here and it made me so mad we are all struggling here including you people who do this your passive aggression is not doing a good job at masking your pain,1,295
does anyone else get very defensive over their food hiding it hoarding it getting mad if family members eat your food etc when i thought my mom used my peanut butter i got inexplicably angry and stressed my anxiety shot up and i immediately blurred out did you use my peanut butter in a kind of frantic state she did not she used a different jar but i was so weirdly defensive over the thought of someone else using my food i usually take weird precautions that i never thought about before now like hiding the jar behind other things in the cupboard hiding my chips pushing my yogurt to the very back of the fridge so it cannot be seen etc i think it ties back to having a scarcity mindset but i do not know i have been in real recovery for about a month now and am just seeing these super odd behaviors and recognizing them as problems,1,161
fuck that one anya taylor joy sitting on a pavement smoking photo actually fuck all that series of pics the ones in which she is getting up to leave too fuck that picture fuck those black clothes fuck this black scarf thing fuck those docs fuck the iced coffee a thousand times and fuck the cigarettes fuck that specific tote bag too something about this aesthetic would be the end of me i do not have anything against her in person obviously though i do not care for qog i do not have anything against the person who took these photos but i hate them and i do not want them to be the anthem to my winter of 2022 also i am way too old to be feeling this way and i hate it too this are not tumblr here for a good reason,1,145
there is nothing glamorous about this shit i can try to embellish this disorder but in the end it is just a mental illness i am sick and it is pathetic there is nothing poetic or profound about being dysfunctional i am not some manic pixie dream fragile girl i am a grown ass woman crying over food obsessing with numbers and exercise and calories and metabolic formulas and maintaining an arbitrary unhealthy weight i am killing myself slowly my body is eating itself and this feels like a secondary worry i am a mess with dark circles and damaged bones and ugly hair and for what why am i even doing this to myself and why cannot i just stop,1,121
does anyone else feel like a teenager but are full grown adults i am 28 but feel 16 and i get so overwhelmed by all this adult crap that i just kind of shut down insurance and taxes and benefits and my job just all seem mentally draining let alone keeping up with housework and meals,1,56

as a man i feel personally victimised by timothée chalamet 20 something dude here deep in a relapse after watching dune this past summer bad idea ever since i have been competing with timmy he does not know for the title of skinniest twinkie to blame timmy alone for this relapse would be dishonest i also blame gay culture every dior male model continental europe my genes every doctor i know my likely neurodiversity etc life has also become more stressful and complicated since i was a teenager so there is also that my life is in shambles but i am not yet at the point where i have abandoned all ambition besides weight loss i am trucking along i have been haunting this sub for a couple weeks i used to be active on proed back in the day may she rip and want to know how my fellow dudes here are doing i am a dude and i know there must be more dudes than just myself here hello even in treatment i have never met another male sufferer of the fucky wucky food flavour of mental illness so i am curious to know how our experiences vary anyway hello i am plastic bottle and i am glad this sub is here,1,214
is anyone else deep in their eds but eating normally like if you were to look at what i eat in a day it would be a pretty normal and balanced diet carbs proteins fats averaging at maintenance calories a few sweets here and there nothing is really off limits and i would not blink an eye if i saw someone else with my diet but my god my ed thoughts are so loud i am trying harm reduction from a few months of heavy restriction and all i think about is food i also cannot restrict much anymore or else my body freaks out it makes me feel like a fraud since what i am eating is actually really really good it is just the dang thoughts ugh,1,129
does anyone else feel as if the resurgence of 00s fashion is fuelling their disordered behaviour even more trigger warning the 00s era of fashion disordered behaviour i saw people talking about this on twitter so thought i would bring my thoughts on it over here for example last year i was already using exercise and a way to unconsciously compensate but my eating disorder developed full swing not long after that cycle began anyways my mum gave me a pair of flared low waist jeans that are 17 years old i tried them on and they did not fit so i decided to lose weight to fit into them and now about six months after i was given the jeans they fit too well it is weird to be praised because my weight loss was not healthy clearly i was very young in the early 00 s was born in 03 but remember being in shops and seeing tabloids with incredibly skinny women does anyone who was older in that era have any thoughts on how this resurgence is doing in my opinion more harm than good edit clarified age in 00s,1,193
anyone else have safe clothes kind of like how they have safe foods i am balls deep into my ed right now and as a result i have become very conscious of how my body looks in certain clothing it is gotten so bad that i have to bodycheck in the mirror approximately 15 times before i leave the house in any given outfit this probably stems from my fear of looking big or curvy in certain clothing like my safe foods i have noticed that i have certain safe clothing i am certain i can wear without having a meltdown these consist of a few articles of clothing that are either baggy enough to hide my body mega comfortable or flattering pieces that make me feel skinni amp fragile does anyone else relate to this or am i just batshit,1,141
you are not on the light side my dad says as he tries to repair my bed frame that is not even broken with wood yet again it has nothing to do with the fact that the bed frame is older than dust is not actually broken and belonged to someone else before me but apparently it will happen to every bed frame i get because i am not on the light side as he says this his words work their way into my ears slither down my throat churn in my stomach and i want to vomit them up i am once again a child i am 8 years old i am told that i am not pretty that i am not like the other girls in my class that my clothes are not nice because my body is not deserving of it that my cousin is so much prettier than i am because she is thin so i run to the bathroom and vomit up the tomato soup i had for lunch and it stings i vomit up his words and hope i can get them all out before they digest and poison my body but they are stuck in my throat and i have to swallow them again i am 12 years old and the only thing i had today was the chinese weight loss tea my sister told me to drink because it will make me pretty because it would make me deserving of love and maybe dad would not be so mean to me anymore maybe i would have friends that would want to spend time with me maybe my mum will not tell me to never wear short sleeves again even though that was my favourite t shirt and it made me feel pretty now i am 21 years old i made yoghurt and granola for breakfast but i cannot eat it my stomach is upset and it is churning and it hurts and i cannot put anything into it his words crawled their way down my throat they churned in my stomach they have made me full and once again i convince myself that i am not hungry that i do not deserve to eat pretty girls do not eat they become angels and float they become light enough to sit on the shoulders of men bigger and taller than them with heads so high they look like skyscrapers from their child like eyes filled with wonder they claim their throne of strong dad shoulders and are told that they are pretty and worth it and are deserving of love but i am not an angel and was always told that i never would be and it hurts even if i skip breakfast and faint for lunch i will not be an angel edit after this incident i was heartbroken and in tears i felt empty and alone but while i am still crying it is for a completely different reason now you are all so lovely thank you for making me feel listened to it is somehow both beautiful and heartbreaking to know that i do not suffer alone again thank you all,1,531

anyone else feel super guilty for using my 600lbs life supersize vs superskinny as fatspo i binge watch these shows when i want to eat and somehow it helps me i am basically viewing these people as everything i do not want to be i know that is mean whenever i am starving i watch amberlynn reid compilations and it helps me restrict ik that is kind of terrible and i feel awful when i actually think about it i do not really binge now but when i used to watching mukbangs helped and now when i am just restricting i cannot help watching supersize vs superskinny and wanting to be the skinny one when their eating habits are just as bad,1,122

commenting on someone is weight totally bit my mom in the ass so id been telling my mom that associating weight loss and gain with good and bad was fucked up she did not really get it because she struggles with her weight and thinks weight loss is inherently healthy right up until the point where you look like you are dying she is a great and supportive woman but her own struggles definitely skew her perspective anywayyyyy one day were out shopping at a vintage consignment shop and this woman asks her to help zip a dress the woman goes on to say that she is been there for a while because on top of sizing for different brands and eras being weird she would recently lost 10lbs and no longer knows her size my moms immediate reaction was wow congrats and then the woman says actually i was recently diagnosed with cancer there was not a whole lot of awkwardness or anything and the woman was really forgiving of it but when my mom and i got back into the car she was like wow i did not even hesitate to congratulate her on an illness and people do it to us all the time people congratulate us on our illnesses all the time if only everyone could get the same wake up call my mom had that day,1,231
does anyone else think their disorder is just their thing i recently found out one of my family members also has an ed while my logical brain knows this is horribly sad that they also struggle with similar tendencies as i do but nah my dumb ass disordered monkey brain broke down crying in the bathroom because they are stealing this from me whenever someone in real life that i know has talked ab ed related things i get very tense like it is my thing having an eating disorder is mine god that is fucked,1,96

oh the logic better eat all the chocolate in the house so i cannot binge on it later and actually stick to a diet next week because that is how it works right right,1,34
so i ate like a normal person for a week while traveling and i did not gain any weight also i pooped more than once a week without pain and my sleep pattern improved greatly anyway i am back to low restricting and sleeping all day now but boy that was a surprisingly good week,1,55
probably not your typical ed story last year while searching reddit for low calorie recipes i stumbled upon an ed related subreddit which i now moderate that she would a lot of light on a situation i did not even realize i had spiraled into as a guy in my early forties eating disorders were about the furthest thing from my mind it began in early 2018 i was sitting on the couch on a saturday morning with a jack and coke in my hand i was close to 100 pounds overweight and feeling disgusted with myself i got off the couch and went for a 2 mile walk probably my first real exercise in years i walked again the next day and every day after that for the next 3 months i also downloaded mfp and added cico to the mix i set a goal to lose 40 lbs which i met within 3 months around that time i gradually began running hoping to continue losing weight and did i ever lose the weight in the coming year i lost another 70 pounds and worked my way up to running half marathons cico and counting calories became a way of life i gradually got serious about running and with that started obsessing over macros i told myself and others it was to be the best runner i could be but the real reason was a deathly fear of gaining weight eating became increasingly complicated at times i would stand in the kitchen for an hour or more stressing over the specifics of my next meal or even a simple snack knowing my wife would get annoyed by me asking her about dinner plans hours in advance i would restrict my calories earlier in the day in case a surprise got sprung on me later in the day sometimes i would regret putting food in my mouth and spit it out one day last summer while showering after a long training run for an upcoming marathon i was overcome with lightheadedness and entered a brief state of delirium i ran out of the bathroom soaking wet with the shower still running and started panicking and saying nonsensical things fortunately my wife was home to give me food and something to drink i was severely dehydrated and most likely depleted of electrolytes i had burned more than 5x the calories i consumed before and during the run i did a little better in the marathon but even still experienced difficulties in the later miles that were likely attributable to calorie restricting all i ever wanted was to be healthy and this remains my goal i am ever so gradually working on these issues becoming more decisive in my food decisions and ever so gradually testing the waters of food that had become unsafe for me i am not really sure why i am here or what i hope to accomplish i guess i just wanted to put my story out into the universe maybe it will be cathartic my best to you all,1,512
unrealistic eating on tv shows been an overweight binge eater my entire life currently winning the battle of the bugle however i love shows like gilmore girls but hate how they project unrealistic eating habits constantly shows that had slim slender fit women eating tons of take out high calorie meals it gave me such a complex because i would always punish myself for being fat and feel like i am not eating different than anyone else and feeling like it is not fair that skinny women can just eat truck loads of foods and i eat a fraction of that as a young overweight girl it projected that some girls were just lucky and made me feel extra bad in real life lauren graham probably worked out 6 days a week and watched every morsal that went into her face but the character made it look like you can just eat trash all day and not be fat it is a real disservice to project that onto young girls now as an adult i relearned healthy eating but i wish tv shows and movies would showcase healthier eating with skinny women instead of this facade,1,196
i have this messed up fantasy where i am taken hostage and kept in a room where someone else controls what i eat they bring me small low calorie unenjoyable miserable meals every so often and that is it i have to starve no matter how hungry i am no matter how much i want to eat and eat and eat i physically cannot eat anything more because i am trapped there is no food available to me at all and i have someone else controlling everything i put in my body this goes alongside my fantasy of becoming critically ill with a disease that makes you lose weight rapidly whilst still getting treated kindly and sympathetically by other people i am not a good person,1,126
what is the cringiest most unhinged thing you have said to someone because of your ed i asked my boyfriend if he had an ideal weight range for me to be in because i wanted motivation to restrict and he looked at me like i was crazy i was and i am,1,52
i ate a proper meal and finished it it was lasagna and bread with butter i did not even feel like shit afterwards i actually felt amazing i am so happy and proud of myself,1,35
what does my ed even want am i supposed to be dainty and airy and light running through fields picking berries and dancing in the sunlight streaming through my windows or am i supposed to literally just look like a walking skeleton sunken eye always on the verge of passing out looking just as fragile as i feel tell me what you want you fool make up your mind edit excellent work folks my most upvoted post is now about the confusion of my goal in having an eating dosorder,1,90
people who claim to have cured their ed by going vegan piss me off so much maybe you had a shitty body image and disordered eating but do not tell me i can undo years of psychological illness and damage throught whole food raw plant based juice alkolotic nongmo joose fuck plan you cannot cure an ed with a diet also i am vegan and still have an ed my life did not become all perfectly plated produce and yoga poses bitch,1,82

burger person last week i was eating a chicken burger before class and one of my classmates said i did not think you were a burger person and i literally cannot stop thinking about it am i a burger person now what is a burger person like what does it mean am i too thin to eat burgers should i never eat a burger again what the fuck is wrong with me why do i care so much every time i see him i think burger person and every time i consider eating a chicken burger i think burger person and every time i try to fall asleep i think burger person um random people please do not comment on my food choices,1,123
i am so much meaner now that i am restricting i am doing everything to remain civil to the people i live with but when they knock on my door try to talk to me or god forbid come into the kitchen or dining room when i am having a pathetic little restriction meal or an actual meal that i am ashamed of i get so angry i cannot even look at them if they say something even slightly off color i snap at them when i used to be able to just shrug i feel like a monster and i know my housemates do not deserve how i am acting i always said that we have a duty to abstain from cruelty despite our own mental health issues and yet here i am,1,134
unpopular opinions only here are some of mine 1 raising awareness can be counterproductive due to social contagion and no just because social contagion is real does not mean the ed is fake or silly 2 few clinicians actually take atypical anorexia seriously  which they should because it is 100 real and dangerous  although they like to pretend that they do because it is woke or whatever 3 a lot of ed treatment is super paternalistic sexist and controlling due to the fact that the majority of patients in treatment are young girls 4 more focus should be on preventing substance abuse and unwanted pregnancy because the ed population have these on much higher rates than the typical population 5 set point weight is really just the weight that aligns with a person s hunger cues which makes sense because genetics lifestyle influences appetite 6 the ed medical field is overrun with people with active eds 7 a lot of ed doctors are actively contemptuous of their ed patients 8 there is a lot of conversation about harm reduction  jazz hands   but in practice clinicians hate this approach 9 fuck jennifer gaudiani,1,192
do you guys know what you look like because i do not it is heavily dependent on whether or not i am restricting so when i am eating higher cals not tracking low key binging to be honest i feel huge and gross and pretty much avoid mirrors during this time come day 2 of restricting and i feel so dainty and cute day 14 i start to worry that i look horribly sick but then on day 15 i will go on ig and see kendall jenner amp all the other size 0s and feel enormous all this with a 2 5lb fluctuation so not all of these things can be true amp i do not know which one is the truth how when does this change in recovery edit for the people that have gained weight as result of their ed or have not really fluctuated but just remained in a larger body ow ob besides possibly not liking your bodies do you feel like you have an accurate idea of what you look like like is it a specific type of ed that disstorts this perception or are we all screwed,1,194
i feel like i have to lose weight to prove that i have an ed i told my boyfriend i was finding food hard again and he was really understanding asked what he could do to help i am regretting telling him though because i have gained gt  15  lt lbs since my lw last summer i am not going to see him for another 6 weeks so i feel under pressure to lose a noticeable amount of weight to prove to him that i am struggling it is ridiculous but i do not feel valid unless i am uw,1,100
one thousand calories the main argument is always 1000 calories is not even enough for a toddler but have you ever seen a toddler they are all fat af so what is your point,1,34

does anyone else get randomly triggered by realizing that someone you did not know was skinny us actually super skinny this is the most vapid and stoopid and vain post ever but today the professor i work for who is a woman at least twice my age showed up for our meeting today in a skin tight velvet dress and looked snatched her stomach is flat as hell her legs are crazy long and she has a great ass and somehow still has tits even though she is insanely skinny and she is been hiding it all this time and i suddenly felt very sick to my stomach and what the furk if my body looked like that i would walk around in a bikini every day and she has the audacity to just arrive on the scene looking like bella hadid as if it is nothing i know it is not normal for other people s bodies to trigger me and it also makes me feel squicky and bad because it almost feels like i am objectifying someone who is a legitimate academic role model for me and reducing her to her body which makes me also feel like a shit person meep end rant,1,206

how do i tell my daughter she is fat i am a caregiver for a dementia patient the family i work for includes a husband wife and two siblings 21f and 19m this evening at dinner as the 21f left the table dad said to me right as she went upstairs how do i tell my daughter she is fat if she keeps this up she is going to be 300 pounds in five years i wanted to punch him in the face this beautiful young lady is tall happy motivated and in love when i see her i just wish i had the focus and confidence she has at her age all i could think about was my ed and yet her father wants to tell her something that could potentially destroy her piece of mind it fucking pisses me off that men in 2022 still believe in the mentality that women need to be thin for potential husbands and a successful career tonight i had serious thoughts about men s impact on developing eating disorders and i regret blaming my mom so much,1,185
anyone else find all the honour your inner child and do it for younger you so so cringe like i do not know i just do not think younger me would really give a shit either way if i had breakfast or not and also she is a past version of me that no longer exists so i do not care what she thinks because it has no repercussions for me laugh my ass off also i swear half the time it is used by aesthetic recovery influencers in quasi,1,90
got called out by my prof oh no so my college is doing in person classes right and they are ending early so the semester is done before thanksgiving usually done 2 weeks before x mas but oh they thought it would just be a okay to give us all extra homework so we get through 16 weeks of material in 13 weeks during a global pandemic so my mental health has been shit constantly getting more hw than is able to be finished in a week i just pulled an all nighter and only got 1 5 assignments done in that time one of my profs noticed that i was not doing well and emailed me concerned i was super uber dissociated and not really thinking so opened up about having multiple breakdowns a day because i have to find time to do all this hw plus work to support myself financially he offered to help me find a therapist so i told him i already had one but thanks he invited me over for dinner with his family as a stress relieving distraction i am nearly incapable of saying no to people so i accepted the invitation at dinner i was offered fresh baked whole wheat bread i said no thanks i had a bowl of soup black bean soup it was decent and 3 asparugus spears in my head i was like ye that is a normal amount of food but will not put you over your limit good job when i finished he offered me more and i did the classic oh no i am full even though i had barely passed into the no longer hungry phase and would probably be hungry again in half an hour his daughter maybe 6 y o said already and my prof said that is what i was thinking that is like a rabbit portion turns to me are you sure and i said yeah yeah i am totally sure and he listed a few foods that he could go grab for me if i wanted more and i said no no really i am all good and he looked at me super serious dead in the eyes and do you know what this man said he he said would your therapist want you to eat more and i was so caught off guard that i froze and just stared at my empty plate like thankfully another one of his children interrupted and he did not continue that line of questioning afterwards,1,423
i never want any man having an opinion on my body i do not know if this is the angry lesbian in me or what but i do not want men to see my body ever i always wear very baggy clothes to hide any of my curves or lack there of i hate when men compliment a woman s body they praise you for having your body pleasing to their eyes like no men do not deserve to see me,1,81
i am in literal shock at what just happened to me at work i was standing in the doorway talking to my boss about a file and she said does not look like there is much in there and our cao walks by and grabs my pant leg and tugs on it and says does not look like there is much in there either and my boss says yeah i was noticing too but did not want to say anything because i have lost so much weight my pants visibly hang off my body like madam i was eating normally this week but congratulations that comment is about to send me back on my bullshit i have never felt so triggered in my life laugh my ass off what is worse is these women are labour and employment lawyers who make hour policies and advise employers so they are fully aware there are rules against making comments on people s appearance in the workplace for this exact reason but there are not nothing that is going to stop old ladies from commenting on people s weight is there,1,188
eating disorders make you ugly actually tiktok shut up that is my goal i swear to god these people are so dense it is really upsetting to think that peoples ideas of why and how people develop eds are so narrow they think shaming is the only way to correct it,1,51
does anyone else feel like a piece of shit because they do not think their ed is bad enough like i go on tumblr and i sometimes see posts like you want to know what anorexia is actually like and it goes on to list all of these horrible things that people go through because of their eds and i low key feel like shit because    i am nowhere near that point i still have my period my hair is healthy i do not have lanugo i am not cold all the time i do not fast for days on end i am not emaciated my life has not fallen apart because of my ed i do not do the stereotypical ed things and it makes me feel like i am not sick enough or i do not have an ed because it is not like that,1,147
okay but i did choose to have an eating disorder and it was a terrible decision that i regret so fucking much i actively chose to start starving myself i actively looked for eating disorder communities to help kickstart this shit i actively looked up ana tips i know that they say that no one chooses to have an eating disorder but i really feel like i did and i hate myself for it,1,74
i rewatched a cinderella story for the first time since i was a little kid and i kind of hate it now the one with hillary duff for clarification partly ed related which is why i am venting here too long i did not read at the end watching this movie now i am much older and have struggled with an ed for a while has really changed my feelings about everything in the movie ed related reasons 1 the bullies popular girls have eating disorders and this is treated as one of their evil traits are they horrible people yes for sure but mental illness is not one of the reasons why 2 if given a choice would you eat a rice cake or a big mac love interest asks our protagonist sam this question while trying to get to know her better this question bugged me so much because on top of making eds an evil trait sam is put on such a high pedestal for not dieting and eating whatever she wants that is great but your diet does not make you superior to others i hate how much this movie implies people who diet bad are diets evil they can be but it is not like following a diet makes someone the wicked witch of the west also i would like to add that the main love interest forgot his name was dating one of the mean girls and somehow did not notice that her or her friends had actual issues in fact it is a joke amongst the whole group there is a joke about laxative abuse it is as if eating disorders are a trendy diet they are teenagers so maybe they did not notice but by senior year of high school i am sure most people would understand that these types of habits are not healthy or normal non ed related reasons 3 vanity evil is a very very prominent theme throughout the movie the evil stepmom is constantly getting plastic surgery the popular girls are all on diets and dress fashionable while our protagonist dresses plainly in reality wanting to look nice is not a negative trait waking up and wanting to look and feel your best is not a sin sam is not better or worse for her fashion sense or lack thereof supposedly she just wakes up and feels her best differently than how the other girls do and this does not make any of them better or worse unless you are in this movie of course 4 kind of adding onto the above but sam is still conventionally attractive i am sure the movie would be very different if she was not 5 there are some strong beauty or brains vibes coming from this movie you should not be teaching young girls or anyone that you have to pick between the two putting on lipstick will not lower your iq reading a book will not make you ugly you can be both you can care about your appearance and be intelligent they are not mutually exclusive tl dr this movie portrays eating disorders as a negative personality trait trendy diet and gives off very very very strong notliketheothergirls vibes thank you for coming to my ted talk now go wash your hands i am pretty sure none of this made any sense because it is late and being in isolation has turned my brain to mush but thanks for reading,1,581
who even greets people like this an acquaintance at my training center just messaged me out if the blue with hope you are not gaining weight in lockdown excuse me why are people like this,1,35

my intern and i were in line at starbucks when she told me i only eat healthy because i see food as sustenance and not enjoyment when we approach the cashier she orders a venti iced coffee with 4 pumps of vanilla 3 pumps of white mocha topped with whipped cream and an everything bagel with cream cheese for lunch she eats several slices of pizza and when our team goes to the grocery store to pick up snacks she picks a box of danishes and red velvet cookies meanwhile my orthorexic ass is sitting here like and feeling super guilty for silently judging her you go live your best life girl laughing out loud,1,115
you all ever feel like you are in the movies because i just went to walmart stoned wearing a beanie a flatsound shirt and an oversized sweater to buy halo top and diet coke which i overdrafted on apparently and skinny love played on the store radio and i am pretty fucking sure i just lived the start of a shitty yes movie,1,63
huge tw does anyone else feel like they are in a silent competition against other people with ed s like seeing all the uw flairs makes me feel so competitive and kind of invalidated to be honest even though i know that that is ridiculous and you can have an ed at any weight when people post bmi s and calories and everything it gets kind of overwhelming even if it is blacked out i cannot help but look to compare myself also lowkey think that sometimes there is some not so subtle flexing on this sub disguised as jokes it sucks since online ed spaces are one of the only places where i feel okay but they simultaneously make me compare myself to others more than i already do irl,1,131
my ed and bpd are like an old married couple that do not live together but sometimes hook up at the weekends for hot crazy sex when i am having a period bout of bpd pain sadness heartache rejection and i am fighting the desire to split and devalue my favourite person it is like my ed suddenly shows up at the door and is wearing nothing but lacy black lingerie and she is like hey baby can i come in and my bpd throws open the door and they are all over each other like a fucking rash had some kind of meltdown with my fp last night and i have shut down because of it but like clockwork my ed is here i have had nothing but a cup of tea and a cup of coffee all day and now i am trying to find out how i can pin an image of a weight conversion chart to my desktop so i can keep looking at it every few minutes this is the best,1,176
anyone else relate or am i crazy me what i do is not nearly bad as often enough to be considered an ed also me obsessed with eating disorder facts spends hours scrolling through the eating disorder tag on every social media site reads eating disorder fan fiction despite not being a part of any fandoms i am just a big fan of their work,1,65
my housmate caught me purging she approached me really hesitantly afterwards and really gently asked me if i would been making myself sick on purpose because she heard me puking when i admitted to it she just wrapped me in a hug told me i am beautiful and if i am ever overwhelmed and need to talk she is there there was no judgement only compassion i am so lucky to have a friend like her edit i did not mean for this to come across as bragging apologies if it sounds like i am i am just so full of relief that my friend responded like this i have been so scared of her finding out,1,117
broke up with my bf and now he is liking pics on twitter of girls who weigh more than me ok but if you were going to be into normal bmi chicks why did i starve myself for 2 years oh right it is because i am insane and pretended you wanted me to look that way in order to validate my own eating disorder,1,65
one of my absolute favorite dishes in the whole world is heavy in calories but you know what i ate it anyway there is this traditional mexican dish that is called chile de queso which is essentially fried pieces of cincho cheese mixed in a spicy green salsa i cannot even begin to imagine the amount of calories it has it is one of my favorite foods in the whole wide world and i only get to eat it about once a year since real cincho cheese is hard to come by but today my mom was able to make some and instead of letting these stupid ed thoughts take over i ate two servings it was absolutely delicious and i am feeling happy and full and proud of myself that is all,1,133
cutting up fruit maybe not the right place but i wanted to share this with someone today i woke up hungover and shaking nothing had happened but i felt huge empty un whole my eyes teared up while my boyfriend tried to comfort me and i knew that however badly i wanted to i could not tell him about the bad thoughts fogging my head i felt like hurting myself i could not stand myself eventually i tried to smile for him and asked him to get himself some breakfast i wanted to make sure he was getting enough food even if i could not face going into the kitchen with him he told me i should eat something too whenever i said no he quietly said oh kay in a kind of voice that made him hold me a little tighter and made me feel a little more guilt nuzzle into my belly he took a long time before he came back upstairs his head bowing to reach the door handle while he hugged two glasses of water and a bowl he brought me the water with a kiss and inside the bowl was a cut up green apple slightly warm from the pantry and sweetly drying on my tongue he must have known i would still feel safe unweighed down eating a piece of fruit that light that he could give me that instead of seeing me refuse everything i wanted to convey to him how much that cut up apple meant to me to me it was the purest act of love a gesture that made me shiver with nostalgia for the times when my mom rapped on the door with a bowl of cut up fruit for me no particular reason just the fruit bearing the memory of her hands peeling rinds and slicing away stems and seeds all of it for me i could not figure out a way to convey this heavy gratitude this strange and personal meaning but i clutched his thigh and whispered thank you we silently shared the cut up apple the bowl sitting between us on the bedsheets our hands equally alternating for the fruit and i quietly noticed first thinking it was accidental eventually realizing it was purposeful that each time his fingers met the bowl his hands nudged the sweeter slices away towards me and would take only the bruised ones,1,403
i wish i could be skinny like a guy and not a girl i do not think i am trans but i wish i could have a boy s body they can get so skinny in such a perfect way as a girl i am always going to have hips and a chest no matter what i want to be looked at like skinny guys are looked at not like how skinny girls are looked at i do not know if this makes sense all the thinspo have ever looked at and liked has been with guys it is not fair i was born like this,1,106

your 2 week diet is not an eating disorder i do not know if this is the competitive part of my ed speaking or if i am actually right i am interested to see what other people think so many of my friends have done fad diets or tried eating in a calorie deficit counting calories or had a gym phase in most cases for these people they did these things for no more than 2 months one of my friends was having lots of health issues and could not eat much because of it she was talking about that time with me and referred to it as her eating disorder when i was in treatment one of the dieticians was talking about unhealthy eating exercise habits but she was making such blanket statements like if you count calories you have an eating disorder i found it extremely triggering because i knew so many people that had success with counting calories that allowed them to get to a healthy weight or overall improve their quality of life when she said that anyone that does that has an eating disorder it made me think that there were so many people that i now had competition with it sounds bad i know but every time i hear someone has an ed i find myself comparing me to them when people talk about their failed diet that they tried for a month then continued living their life normally as their eating disorder it seems to undermine the reality of most ed s it is hard to explain this without sounding like a judge for the anorexia olympics lol can anyone kind of understand where i am coming from though,1,286
a day in my stupid stupid life 12am to 7pm restrict like a tumblr pro ana s wet dream 7pm 7 30pm a good normal dinner because i have suddenly decided to recover 7 30pm 8pm purge because i immediately regretted eating it and then shower to tell myself it was the last time i ever would purge or binge ever 8pm 12am eat one 1 other thing and then binge to all hell and maybe purge some of it making up the entire day s maintenance or more forever be at a high ish but generally very average healthy weight,1,101

so i am in the hospital right not for anything ed related i just have appendicitis but a nurse asked me what i weighed before and i said i did not know because i do not i am in recovery and i do not own a scale and she was like oh the bed will tell me i am sleeping in a scale guys tell me this is hilarious and i am not just ridic high,1,76

does anyone else panic and make up something insane when people ask if you have eaten tell me why i told my colleague who asked if i had eaten that i bought an entire loaf of bread and ate it on my break like girl i promise it is more suspicious to say you ate like 20 slices of bread than saying you did not eat or you could just say something normal like i brought a sandwhich but no of course i decide to lie about eating a loaf of bread fml she looked so horrified but did not ask any more questions,1,104
a little hope and love from someone old enough to be your mother i am in my fifties i feel so much love and concern for many of the lovely people in this community i just want you all to know that you can recover i have been where many of you are right now and i will never say that i will never find myself right back in the thick of my disorder again because let us be honest the bitch can creep right back up on you but i have mostly recovered i tapered off my more destructive behaviors and have not gained an unreasonable amount of weight i have been basically weight stable for quite some time in recovery i have a sane workout routine and never became overweight or obese though in our world s collective skewed idea of what normal is i am skinny normal bmi ftw i just want to offer some love and support and hope to you all if anyone needs a mom adjacent person to talk to when things are rough i am here,1,183
you are invisible with an eating disorder until you are underweight if you do not look visibly underweight and sick you are invisible with an eating disorder i feel completely invisible right now no one will care until you are on death s door and no one will take you seriously i am tired of being invisible and my needs not being met,1,63
i saw the bmi requirements for ballerinas and it has left me low key traumatized i accidentally stumbled upon a height weight requirement from a ballet school i knew that ballerinas had to be underweight but nobody told me that we are talking severely underweight not even kpop idols skinny the kind of skinny that is deemed as extremely dangerous by health professionals skin and bone by normal people the kind of skinny that gets people diagnosed as severely anorexic and on the verge of death you all i know that serious ballet dancers grow up doing this and their bodies probably get used to it but damn i wonder if maybe the reason why dancers have so many injuries and often quit early is inadequate nutrition the weight they demand is such a shocking number to me i am sorry of course boys are allowed a normal bmi and if the reasoning is that ballerinas have to be severely uw for the men to lift them then damn make ballet dancers more buff jesus christ you cannot convince me that deep rooted misogyny and hatred of the female body are not the core of ballet modeling aesthetic sports sorry you all also those of you who grew up dancing i think the entire world owes you reparations for even knowing that sick number as a goal laughing out loud,1,230
you know that first day of restricting after a long while of not doing it feeling it is a mix it is pride for accomplishing my goal of having restraint but it is also despair because i am going to have to do this again for a good 100 days to get to my goal weight and everyone in my life is going to throw a shit fit about me doing this again neuroscientist dr andrew huberman said that addiction is just a narrowing of the things that make you happy and restricting is one of the few things that makes me happy i think about it all the tine even when i am not doing it and have not been for 2 and a half years i live a pretty depressive lyfe thanks echo chamber,1,136
it is not a binge it is your body s nature reaction to starvation whatever tf you call it make it stop,1,22
because i have an eating disorder have you ever just outright said it is because i have an ed in response to condescending questions about your eating habits i hosted my birthday party today and my relatives rummaged through my fridge and pantry and could not stop making comments like why do you have 4 cans of fat free whipped cream what is with all the rice cakes why is everything in your fridge low carb are you doing keto it does not even work you will never lose your fat that way i ended up sitting in my car in the driveway for a good 30 mins after i cut the cake just to sit and cry not because sad that is just my body s response to being very frustrated sometimes i just want to say fuck this and smile sweetly in their faces and tell them all i eat chemical trash because i have an eating disorder,1,160
i told my mom i have a problem with food and then i started crying on the spot i do not think she understands what an eating disorder is but she said she is glad i told her and that she can schedule an appointment with a therapist for me so i am meeting this therapist lady on saturday,1,59
gains weight despite restricting feels so terrible that it causes a binge gains more weight because of binge binges again to make self feel better why do i do this,1,30
everyone talks about unknowingly falling into their ed but who else intentionally dove into disordered eating i was sooooo dumb when i was 16 i wish i could go back in time to slap my dumb ass,1,37
mom you need calories to live ok boomer,1,8
i graduated high school last night and i thought i looked beautiful i ate dinner afterwards with no worries and i even considered going swimming right after however those plans fell through i consider that a success edit i did not expect all your sweet replies and in order to not sound redundant in my comments i just want to say here thank you all there is a reason this community is my favorite on here and in some ways my real life too love you all,1,87
me you do not have to be skinny to have an eating disorder also me i am too fat to have an eating disorder,1,24
people without eds really know nothing about them i was talking about a binge cycle i had a few months ago at work today and everyone thought it was just the funniest thing in the world i told them how i made a whole pan of brownies and ate them all in one sitting and everyone was just like lol mood i even said that was the week i gained 9 pounds in 5 day and one person said that that was awesome because i am so skinny i need to gain the weight like cannot you see that that is super unhealthy like even if i do need the weight is not 9 pounds in 5 days excessive to you that is more than a pound a day and you think that is awesome it was terrible,1,138
you are always eating quote from a guy i used to talk to here is the conversation that ensued hey i actually have an eating disorder that makes it hard for me to eat without feeling bad could you not say that please aww i am sorry its ok that is cute is that why you are so tiny i think i just vomited in my mouth thinking about it like its cute until you watch me cry because my mom wanted me to eat pizza and i did it so it would not break her heart but now i am having a panic attack and punching my legs because i feel uglee,1,113
fuck people who trivialize eating disorders hey i have been in recovery from a restrictive eating disorder for a little more than 2 years and i just want to say fuck everyone who acts like having one is easy or not a big deal being recovered now i started at age 7 so did not remember pre ed time i now get to taste what normal people s lives are like and they are fucking amazing even a shit day now is way way way better than when suffering with my ed for any asshole who tells you to just eat or acts like eating disorders are no big deal i wish they could have one for 10 minutes so they could see what it is like they would change their tunes real fucking quick i love all of you and hope you get out someday,1,146
would not it be all easier if we just were not hungry i am getting tired of this whole humans need to eat thing it is so inconvenient and rude that every time i restrict my body puts all these silly evolutionary mechanisms in place i mean body i am trying to starve here cannot you just play ball and stop wanting to survive for like once,1,67
friendly reminder normal people do not get excited about food poisoning title this thought is presented to you from behind a much needed bowl of broth,1,26
i still have not bought any summer clothes and i keep telling myself it is because i do not want to fall for stupid trends so it is better to wait a little bit more but deep down i know it is because i am hoping to be thinner in a month basically what i said in the title i just wanted to know if anyone else is doing the same,1,71
does anyone else get random bursts of wanting to exercise in the middle of the night at 3 am when you are supposed to wake up at 7 am to attend classes because same body why explain yourself,1,38
does anyone else does anyone get this insane urge to lose as much weight as you can before seeing some you have not seen in awhile a doctor friend etc like i almost want them to be shocked not like enough to confront me and make me change but like notice,1,51
does anyone else cannot stand the gatekeeping of normies i feel like weightloss subs are particularly bad in this regard how disrespectful to real anorexics anorexia is severe you cannot just diagnose yourself you know what i am the stereotypical white skinny girl with sad eyes and no lunch i am the real anorexic they love to talk about and i do not fucking care i do not care what you weigh what you eat what you wear what you say if you share the pain i feel you are sick you are sick and you deserve attention love support whatever you need even if someone was lying why would i care it is not like treatment is even easy to get in the first place so no one is taking my spot no one is undermining my pain i am quite able to do that on my own if anything this gatekeeping only feeds into my ed i feel like if i ever show any signs of normalcy i will not be able to say that i am sick anymore accepting that eds are varied and show up in all sort of ways is actually protecting the sufferers but those fuckers goaling for 18 5 bmi like it is normal it is still healthy you guise 111 1 and eating low cal bullshit making me feel like failure for not dying yet is so helpful right tldr normies do not know shit about us i love you and would protect any of you with my tiny twig arms if i could thanks,1,263
omad and intermittent fasting is a socially acceptable glorified form of ed change my mind in the last few years i see more and more people doing one meal a day most of the time while automatically intermittent fasting i already see some flaws in intermittent fasting as no matter the fast eat window you are still skipping meals or eating more when the fast ends because you are starving but i can see how if you are eating enough it is still ok but in my opinion there is no way in hell a healthy person with a healthy mindset towards food can survive off of one single meal a day i am not even thinking about social repercussions not being able to eat with friends etc but how can the action of eating an entire day s worth of food in one sitting be considered healthy or even beneficial in any way what are your thoughts,1,158
full fat cola supersize vs superskinny i am addicted to this show and in a couple of episodes the narrator has said full fat cola and it made me laugh so much and i have no one else to share this joke with because it is only funny if you have a problem ok thanks,1,55
in the depths of my eating disorder my mom told me i hope one day you can go get ice cream with me and not worry about how many calories are in it i am out with her getting ice cream right now she probably does not remember ever saying it but that statement left a huge impact on me it gets better i promise,1,65

stood up to binge amp sat back down i made a carrot cake n had a small piece with my family just for company n i was super anxious that it would trigger me later i was going to get up amp unwrap another piece but i just realized it would not fulfill me like i just sat back down and went on my phone instead this is not big but its a nice win,1,75
warning for emily in paris yes lily collins is triggering in every way and i am almost positive she is lost more weight,1,23
my mother who spends her days harassing me for not eating enough just commented on what i was eating so i stopped my parents bought some nice sliced cheese from the deli yesterday when they got home both of my parents independently told me there was this particular cheese in the fridge and i was welcome to have some so today i was eating cheese and crackers i was planning to have three crackers cheese there were ten slices of cheese in the container i was finishing my second cracker and had consumed less than 1 4 of one slice of cheese thus far and my mum saw me eating it and said oh eating all of your father s cheese are you i smiled finished my second cracker and put everything away my mother spends every single day harassing me about not eating enough looking sick needing to admit myself to hospital threatening to get legal decision making power etc but she really thought commenting on me eating especially with those words was a good idea how am i supposed to keep eating after eating all of this brings me to a greater point why does anyone think it is okay to comment on how much or how little someone is eating,1,213
you know what your girl wants this winter a stomach flu just for a couple of days i just need good old diarrhea and dehydration to drop some weight every girls dream correct me if i am wrong,1,38
do you ever get a disordered thought that is so disordered it makes you laugh possible trigger warning i was planning what i am going to eat today as one does and i realized that i am craving this specific snack but i knew that it might trigger a binge or even if it would not i would feel guilty after eating it anyway so i decided not to have it and after analyzing what else i could eat without feeling guilty my mind just said you will not feel bad if you do not eat and i just accepted it like yeah yk what you are right you cannot go wrong if you just do not eat anything and then i replayed what i just thought and like what the fuck haha how are these actual thoughts that i think in full seriousness humans need to eat like,1,149
i think skinny faces are really aesthetically appealing but unfortunately my face is the exact opposite even when i am underweight my face is genetically fat as fuck there have been times where i thought my body was too skinny and i saw my ribs through my chest and back and was like yuck but i still want to lose a lot more weight even just so my face can be skinny i wish i had nice cheekbones and a good jawline and my face did not puff up to twice it is size when i smile and make me look like a chipmunk i am so incredibly jealous of people like those plus size models with faces that are somehow still skinnier than mine i feel like people judge your overall weight a lot more based on your face than body really and it is so much easier to hide literally anything else people with skinny faces look so elegant and sophisticated to me and i almost feel like with my face type i cannot really be taken seriously and you do not really see people with chubby faces on tv the beauty standard nowadays at least in movies and obviously among models and the like seems to be having razor sharp features in general at least masks are a thing now,1,223
i keep seeing sw cw ugw on weight loss subs and mistaking them for ed subs like wow you mean there are actually people who are not disordered but want to lose weight what a mind blowing concept seriously though i do not know why but i thought those terms were specific to the ed community yeah ok it is time for me to get off tumblr,1,67
a reminder for those of you in school college uni your brain needs calories to function if you restrict to really low numbers or fast while you have got lectures you will not be able to focus and you will not remember much please try and eat something just before or during your lecture my choice for today is just a plate full of strawberries it is probably not enough to help me properly focus but i am working my way up to something more substantial these disorders take so much from us do not let it take away your ability to to learn too even though school uni is really stressful restricting will not help you feel more in control it will just make it worse try and look after yourselves,1,132
say it louder for the brain cells in the back i did not gain weight i just did not poop,1,20
real life thinspo why why must you exist in my presence stop,1,12
my skinny model friend uses me as fatspo she was the first friend i made when i moved to la for college it is so mean and i know we both struggle but i do not know why she had to tell all of our friends this,1,47
you are not going to become ginormous if you start eating how you would like to i lost 70 pounds after being the biggest i have ever been for an entire year i restricted and continued to restrict after my weight goal because i was too afraid of gaining weight if you see the what i eat in a day in recovery videos most of these people are still super small even when eating like 3000 calories per day for months and months i thought i was going to start gaining tons and tons of weight when i began eating more 2 months ago i thought none of my clothing would fit me that my stomach would become huge that everyone who praised me for my weight loss would notice that i have gained weight but that did not happen instead i just stopped feeling light headed hungry and obsessive all the time i still look the exact same i am just not ravenously hungry all the time the size small skirt that i bought during the summer still fits my t shirts are still baggy and i have not mysteriously formed a double chin and neither will you you will not gain 100 lbs you will not lose control over your body and your clothing will still fit you fine you will be absolutely fine,1,226
if i ate how i really wanted i would be over 1000lbs feel like i have the biggest appetite in the world,1,22
going to pride i ate an orange eggplants and some rice got an apple and some strawberries on my bag nothing s stopping me today okay we are gay and we are not fainting,1,34
why do dudes get so defensive about liking underweight women it is cool the media has shoved them in their face just the same as ours as being the ideal i am not judging but if you point out yep she is almost certainly underweight they start foaming at the mouth what do you want her to be a fat pig can women not be skinny anymore body positivity has gone too far fit toned thin women are shamed you are just jealous you are probably fat she is naturally slender look she still has boobs underweight women do not have boobs like mate i am not calling you a dickhead or anything i am just saying she is almost certainly not healthy or at the very least eats a severely restricted diet to get to where she is i am smaller than 99 of the women i have pointed out i know what underweight looks like it is fine to think she is hot i think she is hot why cannot they just acknowledge it is not achievable for their wife girlfriend to look like that without starving themselves to some extent it is like they are insistent on considering women lazy unless they uphold an ideal that is physically dangerous to get to,1,215
just took the biggest shit in my life and cleared out my entire digestive system dude i wish i had weighed myself before i am positive i just excreted 1 solid pound of shit and emptied my colon entirely i almost needed a poop knife to deal with it it was so massive i feel so pure and light and my bloating has gone down so much it could happen to you too believe in your digestive tract thank you and goodnight,1,82
my mom wanted me to be skinny since the moment i was born so to begin my mom has anorexia she is had it for years before she even met my father she is a person who makes being skinny her whole identity it is frustrating because especially during the periods where she does eat a lot she projects her own wish to be skinny onto me since i was a child she would literally starve me if i did not know any better my mom invented the phrase skip dinner wake up thinner she wanted everyone in the world to know that she is skinny and so is her daughter and now to get back to the title of my post and the whole identity thing i just found out how she engraved her wish to be a skinny queen into my very existence my name is macey but my official name is macilenta like any child does i asked my parents why they called me that my dad told me my mom made it up and he thought it was very pretty and my mom always said it is latin and it means beautiful for almost all my life i believed this until i recently became friends with a latin major we had a conversation about random stuff and our names came up i told her my name was short for macilenta and that it stands for beautiful then she freaking shook her head at me and said that it is not beautiful macilenta is a modification of the word macilentus which translates to skinny my name means skinny i fucking hate her for doing this to me not the word itself but she fucking signed her toxic identity into my name if a mother literally calls her child skinny the child is fucking doomed the second it is born good to know that it was not some event that caused my ed it is started the moment i was shat out in the hospital,1,337
going against science and nutritionists who claim cookies are not filling i mean not to brag but after eating a mere 10 i am full of self hatred,1,28
conversation i just had with myself i do not have an eating disorder then eat well do not go that far,1,21
some of us are unhinged and not in a good way i get that eds brig out the worst of a person or in general transform someone is personality and that this is a safe space to vent without fearing being judged but sometimes you just need to shut the fuck up i mean shit like commenting i would never recover because of fear of weight gain laughing out loud xd on a post that literally says coping with extreme hunger in recovery tips or something like that is just spiteful that post was not for you and guess what if you want to be competitive do a fucking post dedicated to it but do not try to make others miserable to just lift yourself up you are just mean ed or not,1,133
went to the store and got diet soda and halo top today and felt like a poser because i am a fat girl buying skinny food even though i am at a normal bmi had a bit of a relapse after over a year of normal eating started eating at maintenance again a few days ago and my brain cannot handle it i am having the worst body dysmorphia and i am under the assumption that everyone around me sees me as fat i know it is totally irrational but the thought is so intense it just feels strange grappling with these feelings for the first time in a while also facing imposter syndrome when it comes to my ed ik i am disordered but i have not fasted or purged in several months and i have not been underweight in a year so it feels invalidating at times,1,149
when non ed people forget to eat my partner was anxious today and forgot to eat the day before he forgot lunch i hate how obsessed i am with food i never forget to eat and i am intentionally starving myself i think about food the moment i wake up and it invades every single thought i have yet people like my partner and brother have the audacity to just forget does anyone else with they just had the ability to forget to eat,1,84
boyfriend called me fat during sex i relapsed bulemic when i was on top he said you are so fat it is so hot i am underweight with a small stomach it instantly turned me off but i let him finish i think he knows something is up edit i talked to him and he was upset because i was so cold to him he was upset because he cannot handle it when people reject him in that way but he said that he has to be more careful in the future another thing is that i have been abusing certain drugs recently to not be hungry and i told him about it and he is upset about this he is not really talking to me since update communication is key we talked again and he apologised a lot and said that he had no intention to harm me he feels really guilty and he will be more careful in the future he also meant with fat my ass which makes me feel a little better,1,176
i have been so so active the last few days i am starting to recognize usernames and i love it it makes me feel like we are all a bunch of friends,1,32
jealous of exercise addicts instead i am lazy do not restrict and do not have enough discipline to get what i want i envy those who work out constantly no matter how hungry or tired they are why was i not blessed like that i have no motivation or discipline,1,50
i will diagnose everyone who adds water instead of milk to their oatmeal with an ed there is no fcking way anyone would do this because they actually enjoy the taste more,1,32
ed tiktoks i seriously do not understand people with eds specifically an who make tiktoks eating on camera while crying or somthing like that tell me if i m wrong but i can t sympathize with those people because it just feels like seeking attention as in oh my good look how hard it is for me to eat i have an too and i understand that it can be emotionally super difficult especially with fear foods but i think those tiktoks just perpetuate stereotypes for example disordered people eating only half an apple a day most people don t acknowledge messy binges at night that happen off camera,1,109
those stupid stock photos of anorexics it is always a thin girl in a tight shirt or something totally put together looking sad pushing away a plate with a single leaf of lettuce or a single piece of bread they are so cringey like why who is idea was this,1,50
my family keeps joking about 1 of the side effects of my restriction so i had a heavy restriction phase last year and during that phase i had severe constipation which led to me having an anal prolapse when this happened my mom told my whole family about it and it is been a huge joke ever since i am 21 by the way they all know and understand that i have an eating disorder and that is what led to the prolapse yet they still joke about it i am going to be honest it is fucking embarrassing i cannot go to the restroom without it falling back out i am too young for doctors to do any procedures to fix it it makes me feel disgusting please do not be mean in the comments i just want you all to be reminded that even though we joke about constipation and our disorders as a whole we have legitimate illnesses with very real consequences i love you all i just really needed to talk about this,1,177
i am absolutely doing this for attention i mean it very sincerely i want to look sick i want people to worry about me i want to be on the brink of death i want to be miserable i want someone to comfort me and for people to whisper about how sick i look when they see me and to get worried glances wherever i go and to get skinny shamed and to have people be irrationally jealous of me jesus fucking christ i will just take any form of attention please give it to me,1,96
does anyone else see a skinny person and think hmm i wonder how many calories does she eat daily assuming the person does not have an ed and never excercises,1,30
seeing old anorexics is so sad not like i should go recover now i am killing myself sad more like damn maybe people did not lie when they said recovering when you are at your goal weight is not that easy there is this anorexic woman on tiktok who is fairly old and wants to recover and she always says i feel too thin i look to ill damn living in a body like that when you do not get the high of your dumb ass skinny shit really must be terrifying,1,92
anyone else hoard calories for end of day i struggle with it but i fast until dinner and just gorge myself with all my daily calories over the next couple of hours i never gain weight because i get my calories without going over they are just in one meal i feel like i am cheating the system because i can eat whatever i want as long as i do not go over and i have all my calories to eat i hate that i am now like this and now i am scared to eat breakfast or lunch because i will not have as many calories to have fun with at dinner am i the only one that does this,1,121
when you see recovery tiktokers who have been posting food n recovery stuff for like 8 months and they are still emaciated very triggering indeed like if i give recovery a shot for one month i am basically weight restored sigh,1,41
great news i have decided i no longer have an eating disorder this is sinply the body i was born in sorry to everyone here but i am leaving this community because i have self undiagnosed i am tired of having an ed good luck babes,1,46
showing your pain by losing weight does anyone else feel like they want to show their pain by just whittling away like you are not seen regularly so to justify this you just outwardly project it i take every single little inconvenience painful memory self depricating thought and unfortunate turn of events and feed it into the fire of this disorder i cannot be the only one then when you hide it   the reason for the weight loss  it is like you are winning your own secret game,1,88
this sales pitch is not ok i had to run an errand and my s o asked me to stop and grab him a bag of chips i am paying and this guy walks up to me and says are those for you i hope you find time to exercise and tries to hand me his business card he is a personal trainer i just walked away but it really hurt and made me really angry what the fuck gives him the right to comment on what i buy if there are any fitness nutrition folks reading this please stop using this tactic you have no idea what someone is going through and how hurtful that kind of thing can be just stop,1,123
my birthdays tomorrow and i am leaving this thread for good i am ready to start my 25th year of life the way i always dreamed with that said i absolutely adore each and everyone of you and wish you the best for your own life journeys recovery always seems impossible and then it is i love you goodbye,1,59
i do not believe in body positive people trigger warning sorry if this is negative this is just how i personally view it i really do not believe that they are body positive first of all 1 a lot of them just resent skinny bodies instead of celebrating all bodies it is like they are mad that they could not be skinny or something i do not know and then go shame all skinny people what is that 2 when they are youtubers they literally have a snatched waist and put it on their thumbnails which they probably photoshop to look even more snatched on the thumbnail does not look the same in the video to me and then rave about how you should not be afraid to gain weight but they are too and then later cry about it i am so confused like body positivity is basically another form of toxic positivity you were telling me no it does not matter but then you are having a breakdown about it and then i am like shit ok i should change too it is literally toxic positivity 3 they give so much attention to people with amazing bodies they always want to comment on other people s bodies i know that you want to be nice and everything but is it really necessary to tell someone woah your stomach has gotten so flat woah look at that waist in front of everyone fun fact that happened to someone at a friend s party i went to is it necessary to always bring up someone is body shape in the conversation omg that girl has an hourglass figure look one of my friends okayyyy maybe i am just insecure as hell laugh my ass off but it becomes uncomfortable at some point i once read something about how we should be body neutral instead of body positive because all the focus on the body is negative i agree let us like talk about something else please edit okay so i really apologize for point 1 i did not mean that all body positive people resent skinny people you all that came out so wrong i am so sorry i meant that i have seen a portion of instagram influencers that brand themselves as body positive say things like i do not want to look like a 14 year old boy child and no one wants to look like a stick and shit like that you can celebrate a body without putting another one down is basically what i am saying edit 2 i apologize for my terrible grammar in this post lmaoooo i do not even know how you guys managed to read this but i am happy to see that i am not the only one who feels this way and that i was able to get my message across,1,481
why do muggles think we do not eat at all i know there is a post like this like every day but it just pisses me off so much when somebody asks did you eat anything today uwu like bro obviously yes do you think i live off of energy i draw from the universe that i look up to the sun and charge myself with its warmth that i plug myself into a fing wall why cannot you understand that comments like this make me feel like i should not be eating at all and make me feel guilty about the food i ate because i supposedly should live off of nothing,1,113
not f cking with you my boyfriend fed me in my sleep ok ok ok so this happened months ago but it is taken me awhile to figure out how to word this pure insanity i am a sleep talker walker basically a very active sleeper apparently one night my boyfriend made a big pot of pasta my starving sleeping ass allegedly asked for some and ate apparently a lot of it pasta while sleeping sorry for the caps i just find this to be absolutely wild and hilarious and terrifying has this like happened to anyone else laughing out loud i doubt it but i am just curious it has not happened since thank goodness but yeah this is my story,1,122
am i an asshole for finding fear food tiktoks really funny so if you have not heard there is a side of ed recovery that is equally cringe as ed tiktok and what these people in recovery would do is record themselves eating a fear food however many of these people would be shaking and crying eating something like a burger or a pizza or whatever of course there are people who record themselves and they eat it normally and finish it but with others i feel like they purposely up the drama and record themselves with their hands shaking like hell and hyperventilating like i watch those tiktoks and i am like because i know any other junkorexic could fuck up a burger as their omad i do not know i just do not understand someone seeing themselves cry and go you know what i need to record this,1,150

it really hits different when someone you know in real life is your thinspo idek how to explain it like yea i see thinspos from tumblr instagram and twitter everytime and sure i get a bit triggered or whatever but once its someone you know like this person is not just a picture and is living and breathing and knows you and acknowledges you its like  damn people like that actually exist i do not know i know a couple of my bf s close friends are these kind of girls literally the type you would see in thinspos fashionable tall and dainty i cannot help myself but compare to them yknow especially when they are close friends with my bf  its so frustrating i feel like i will never win in this bcs obviously i do not want my bf to not see his friends ever again but also literally just a mention of their names picture i get so   crazy and unfortunately he can sense it too i hate this so much i love my boyfriend and i do not want to put him through this but at the same time i cannot help but feel frustrated when i think about him hanging out with literally my thinspos i do not know i am so tired,1,218
serious discussion why do people lack the ability to empathize with eating disorder sufferers please give me your theories out of all the mental illnesses i have anorexia is the only one that people literally do not even try to understand at all i just do not get it in addition to my eating disorder i have been diagnosed with bipolar type 1 ptsd anxiety and struggle with addiction alcoholism out of all those diagnoses the only one that people literally do not even bother to try to understand is the anorexia most people are extremely empathetic about the ptsd and anxiety and while bipolar is misunderstood sometimes people do not make as many ignorant comments about it as they do my ed and when i explain the brain chemistry behind the mental illness they get it but i have got good friends of mine who i have told time after time about my struggles with ed over this relapse the last 4 months and they continually just do not get it at all why is that why is it so difficult for people to empathize with eds my friends who do not have alcoholism somehow still manage not to say triggering stuff about that and can respect my boundaries and they get that being an addict is not a choice but something i have to manage regardless my friends who do not have anxiety are still capable of comforting me during a panic attack my friends who do not have ptsd understand why seeing a man who assaulted me in public can because me to spiral my friends without bipolar may have never experienced mania or suicidal depression but they believe me when i say i am miserable and in pain yet when i confide in people about my ed it is always the same sorts of things over and over well you do not look bad you still look healthy i mean 800 calories a day is not that little just try eating a bit more between meals purging is nasty oh yeah i did not eat like anything today either i just was not hungry rant incoming 1 people do not understand the serious medical implications of struggling with an eating disorder particularly when it comes to long term restriction and purging you do not have to be 70 pounds to die of an eating disorder 2 why do people need physical evidence of an eating disorder being bad before they give a shit no one needed evidence when i relapsed into drinking my grades were still perfect and i drank alone so people did not see but when i told people i was miserably drinking myself into a hole every night they believed me no one said some ignorant shit like well you are not drunk right now so clearly there is no problem or when i say i am depressed and considering suicide no one says well you do not cry all the time so you are fine why are the physical indicators so necessary for eating disorders to matter guys i am honestly so upset every person i tell about my eating disorder either gives the stupidest advice try a protein shake etc or tries to force feed me or compares their experience to that time they lost their appetite due to the flu or says i am being stupid by starving myself these are good friends of mine who are super understanding and kind and empathetic when it comes to my other mental illnesses what is it about eating disorders that make them so much harder to understand or empathize it upsets me because i feel like my friends are not even trying and if they are i do not feel like eating disorders are so complex that you cannot see that continuously making body comments either positive or negative or other rude offensive reactions might be detrimental to me it makes me want to isolate and never talk about it again and just starve myself to death alone in my house,1,679
for the short people on ed anonymous i so hear you i hate when people say you eat way too little assuming you need 2000 or 2500 calories like them to maintain your weight no karen i cannot eat as much as you i need the amount some people on diets would eat because i am half as tall and yes i wish i could eat as much as you without becoming obese no matter how many times i explain this to my tall mom she will not fucking understand and think i am restricting or eating too little which i often do but then even when i eat at maintenance she still criticizes me i am 5 0 so   ya ll let me know what your experiences are do you also have those i know best people around you acting like they know what you need in order to be healthy annoying as hell,1,155
if i was skinny i would still have problems but at least i would be a hot girl with problems,1,20
boring having an ed makes you boring not special not cute not quirky it makes you rigid and neurotic it is taking away from your personality and accomplishments you cannot grow into your full self and still hold onto your sick weight if you think you can you are lying to yourself i am saying this mostly for myself but i know someone else needs to hear it too,1,69
want to start purging this post is for you regardless of your bmi current ed your walk of life purging will fuck you over a purge is a bandaid solution you know that you might be interested in doing it to start fresh after a bad binge maybe you were forced to eat out with friends family and you ate what you did not want to you want to be the cool girl guy who looks like they eat whatever and stay   get skinny maybe you do it for self harm purposes as someone moving from bed to bulimia here is what i have concluded appearance i am not saying you all are like me but i can be vain as fuck and put my appearance first here is what you get with purging weight change i know this is obviously the big thing obviously the scale goes down compared to before a purge but you are losing a lot of water stomach acid etc which gives you this false sense that you are losing weight in reality most bulimics will maintain or more likely gain weight longterm even though you are correcting your purge most bulimics are in the normal overweight bmi and not formally diagnosed teeth are fucked thin sensitive yellow and breath smells bad all the time the skin around your mouth will be ravaged it will be raw and you will break out in pimples and weird texture from the stomach acid snot tears vom bile that comes up swollen glands make your cheeks v chipmunky my face looks like an amorphous pancake compared to my body and bmi nothing will help accelerate your face getting back to normal not diuretics changing water intake electrolytes it goes a little with each day you do not purge bloodshot eyes petechiae burst capillaries around your facs nothing really helps it go away faster it just takes days your hands will get scarred and tears and bleeding heartburn and stomach pains 24 7 gut flora is fucked to high heavens burps and farts so much gas goddamn and lots of bloating surprise involuntary regurg is a bitch nothing cuter than purging out of your nose or pissing your pants because of the strain of purging splashback is also a very real thing and so is the toilet blocking up big time your throat is raw and painful increased episodes of tonsilitis feelings and functioning i hear people purge because the purge itself gives them a high let me warn you you may lose the purge high i do not feel calm or good or pure like i used to after purging everytime i near the end of a dissociative binge i absolutely hate and fear the purging after some like me purge to gain back the loss of control that occurs with a binge or the guilt after eating anything at all there is nothing that makes you feel as helpless and out of control than getting stuck in a b p cycle after you purge food your body is prepped and rearing to break down food so with the food gone your hunger level comes back to before or worse i always thought i would have better control than to get stuck in a b p cycle but i swear it is a slippery slope that inevitably happens my gag reflex has been desensitised so my methods of purging become more and more aggressive i am sure if i had a dental check up i would have bruises down my throat you will lose electrolytes purging which means more fainting lightheadedness poorer concentration in work study purging comes with increased risks of losing consciousness and if you pass out at the toilet bowl you could at least chip a tooth at worse because life threatening damage and choking whilst purging which is damn terrifying social life and finances do not be blindsided by thinking purging will let you have a better social life afterall most social activities involve food right the fear of choking during the following purge will get you choosing foods you do not even like so that it comes back up easier you will be the odd one who always runs to the bathroom afterwards or has to leave as soon as possible to purge if you cannot purge in time the anxiety floods in and you read me may get a bit mental you will at some point have your purging session interrupted by someone whether it is by a stranger in a restaurant bathroom a friend a family member that shit is mortifying and isolating you will get more and more desperate with where you purge maybe it starts out in the safety of your home one thing leads to another and you are ready to purge at the vilest jackson pollock y gas station toilet gross and unhygienic but you cannot help yourself b p cycles read later in this post are fucking expensive you are buying food that will not stay long enough to give you macronutrients or micronutrients you are literally flushing money down the toilet one thing that keeps me up at night is the disgust i feel knowing i wasted so much food resources time energy and money because of this disorder this is an elaboration on my response to this post thanks you holdencaulfield7 for encouraging me to make this a separate post at the end of the day i can only share my warnings and experiences with you all the temporary good is nothing compared to the harms it is given me and i still feel shackled to this disorder daily please be careful you all and rethink starting purging edit i am reading all your comments by the way i have so much love for all of you sharing your stories no matter what stage you are with purging love this community stay strong thanks for the gold and silver too darls,1,997
overweight people in pro ana communities make me sad disclaimer 1 i am not fatphobic please read the full story disclaimer 2 i do not in any way encourage joining pro ana communities and will therefore not share what platform and community this is happening in so i want to discuss something that i have been noticing a lot lately a while ago i joined a pretty active pro ana community in which you can chat about struggles give advice and share accomplishments what i have realized later is that there is also a place to share body checks this is where i was surprised most body checked were from people who are overweight not only that they were posted by the same people who have been giving me heart wrenching advice on how to lose an extreme amount of weight and eat the smallest amount of food this made me realize even more how unrecognized and unvalidated overweight people with anorexia must feel i feel terrible knowing that people who want to get healthier by losing weight engage in dangerous activities and go to the other extreme i feel terrible that i was so wrong about the majority of anorexics and i feel so bad that they are not only not believed by most non anorexics when they say they are anorexic but even many people with the same struggles the name pain and the same dangerous illness do not see them as equal,1,245
people who reassure me that it is okay to eat only leads to a binge i know they mean well but i have zero self control being told to eat only allows me to binge i have to eat very clean if i am restricting no sugar if i eat one piece of junk food i feel that i have sabotaged my whole diet and my mind goes oh well i can eat this and this and i will just start over tomorrow i spiral out of control and the binging goes on for days it gets bad life is easier when i am restricting and feel like i have control of myself but the constant thought of food is always there and i am always on edge to binge i hate this so much,1,135
bf said would not have sex with me unless i ate a full meal i hate the way it worked panda express chow mein hits different when you know you are about to get railed also guys never break a multiple day fast with cheap chinese food oh my god edit oh my god he does not do this normally he just got upset that i had not eaten for x days and he looked at my fasting tracker and got more upset he does not withhold sex so i do what he wants this was just a funny little one time thing because he watched me vomit bile in the mall parking lot i am usually the one in control and getting what i want constantly while starving probably is not good for my disorder so i kind of needed to get knocked down a peg and get that control dynamic shifted,1,153
fiona apple did not have to go off with paper bag like that nothing tastes as good as skinny feels is for amateurs and posers do not me hunger hurts but starving works when it costs too much to love that is it you have distilled restrictive eating disorders to their bare essence i have got to fold because these hands are just too shaky to hold,1,67

how do people in the fasting community do it these motherfuckers are going over a week without eating and they are so chill about it you all do not feel like you are fucking dying after 2 days of no food my body feels like it is shutting down and these bitches are going a monthhhhhhh i do not understand,1,60
showing your pain by losing weight does anyone else feel like they want to show their pain by just whittling away like you are not seen regularly so to justify this you just outwardly project it i take every single little inconvenience painful memory self depricating thought and unfortunate turn of events and feed it into the fire of this disorder i cannot be the only one then when you hide it   the reason for the weight loss  it is like you are winning your own secret game,1,88
the guy i am seeing told me he likes that i am not too skinny but not too fat right after i told him i had an ed laughing out loud men have no idea what they are saying,1,39
boring having an ed makes you boring not special not cute not quirky it makes you rigid and neurotic it is taking away from your personality and accomplishments you cannot grow into your full self and still hold onto your sick weight if you think you can you are lying to yourself i am saying this mostly for myself but i know someone else needs to hear it too,1,69
eds into old age i work in a skilled nursing facility and we have a resident who is in her 90s and used to be a model she receives a select menu where she picks out her meals for the following week every time i bring it to her to complete all she does is mention how much more weight she needs to lose and cutting back on food i remember one night it was dinner time and she was desperately trying to get out of the dining room so she would not have to eat dinner it is so upsetting i cannot say she has an ed but i mean is this what we have to look forward to when we are old still worried about restricting calories and losing weight that is so depressing,1,136
we should make no holocaust comparisons or references a sub rule triggered,1,12
hot take we need to stop acting like asking someone if they have an ed is a terrible thing let me explain a little here there is an obviously disordered youtuber it honestly does not matter who she is and her videos are boring as fuck you would not like them the main point is that she is extremely uw and has very strict food rules and anyone who would not think hmmm this does not seem like a normal or healthy diet when watching her videos literally does not have their brain turned on but if you suggest it in her comments or even on the comments of a video specifically pointing out how fucked up her eating is there is always someone who will respond you do not know her how dare you accuse her of something like that accuse her of something like what an eating disorder that she exhibits many symptoms of and that affects nearly 10 or 30 million americans in their lifetime this is the terrible unspeakable thing we cannot possibly accuse her of what the fuck like can you imagine if an influencer just pounded shots of vodka during all their videos but if anyone commented yooo do you have a drinking problem because this is not healthy and everyone responded like how dare you you do not know her like sure i do not but i have eyes and a brain and i am watching this content right now and she is clearly drinking way too much way too often x200b i have not put much thought into this beyond watching the video and then typing this post right now so opposing views welcome,1,282
i just ate a whole pizza for the first time one of those you buy in the freezer in grocery stores can someone please be proud of me edit i am sorry i cannot thank all of you individually but truly thank you guys so much you are support has really helped me fight my mind,1,56
something i think a lot of people do not know about eds is truly how gross they are like the image people have of the thin perfectly feminine girl with a hollow face and shiny long hair is honestly hilarious eds are gross you feel gross you look gross the deeper you get the nastier you feel and look you do not feel pretty and even if you are able to look decent one day your hands are still cracked your skin dry and eye bags heavy and i do not think i will ever have good hair again all this coupled with just being exhausted all the time and having no energy for self care or beauty i think people would be shocked to know the truly disgusting bodily side effects that come with eds too people look at me and think wow she looks like shit people ask me if i am sleeping ok if i am struggling because of school my friends think i have given up things like make up skincare the feminine aesthetic because i have followed the trend to be natural or even spiritual no i just have an eating disorder lmao and you do not know what that looks like apparently,1,208
it so weird that you have an ed but you eat so unhealthy thanks jessie i am sorry my bulimia does not match up to your personal idea of what my bulimia should be jessie,1,35
aaaaaaa my favorite pizza place just reopened after 3 year f ana we eating good tonight i do not give a fuck what my ed has to say to day i just went on my first date now i am going to fixing to have some pizza my ed can cry about it,1,53
my bf told me that i have let myself go i am in recovery and i have gained some weight from it i am giving up i worked so hard for what i do not even know why i am posting this,1,42
it annoys me how even people with eds buy into the you are not losing weight because you are too underweight and eating too little shenanigans i mean yeah it is true that the less you weigh the more you have to restrict to keep losing weight because metabolism is a function of your weight and height age but it is not like once you are underweight you are never going to lose weight again it is still calories in calories out if you are at a deficit you will lose weight unless you are literally at bmi 10 or something maybe but if you are not about to drop dead and are at auschwitz levels of extreme emaciation and even then they did eat up to more than a thousand calories each day you will not stop losing weight on deficit amounts and your metabolism does slow down but not by that much that if you eat i do not know 500 or 1 000 cals or whatever you are not going to lose weight because metabolism i mean seriously edit a few commenters are finding the mention to the concentration camps inappropriate and weird i am sorry i did not mean to be inappropriate i literally just wanted to use that as a reference,1,216
when people unprovoked let you know that they have not eaten alll day why i am confused i feel like it is only really people who are not disordered too or is that an incorrect observation lol when i was very actively engaging in behaviours i never ever made any comments on my own diet or intake in front of others i would only talk about what i ate if someone offered me food so i could say no and justify why i am saying no,1,86
today is my birthday all calories are on me eat anything you want today besties i will absorb all your calories,1,21

why do you guys want to be skinny so badly my reasons 1 if a guy leaves me for another girl i can tell myself at least she is not skinnier than me it is very insecure and toxic i know 2 skinny looks elegant and although i do not mind it on other girls at all looking thick makes me think i look cheap,1,65
is it just me that goes through phases of not being disordered for a while and then going back to it again like every couple months i just start eating normally i usually eat a lot of junk food and what i did not usually let myself have but i will not care as much about calories whereas before i have to track every single one and i am just like idgaf i am going to eat what i want because i want to and i try not to look in the mirror it kind of feels like my ed does not exist i think i do this until i get upset about how i look again and want the control back it is balancing between being in control and therefore less anxious about my weight and eating enough and therefore having actual energy and feeling good physically do not get me wrong though tracking does not take away anxiety if anything it makes it worse to be honest it was not like i was losing when restricting anyway i might as well eat,1,184
how do some really sick and thin anorexics survive for so many years just browsing a certain ed forum that is pro ana and i see some really low bmis below 15 post for years and years and are still able to function somewhat properly then you have eugenia cooney who is been bone thin for a long time and still posts videos regularly how am i supposed to recover knowing that i can actually live for that long being a walking skeleton,1,83
i hate recovery accounts i know some are helpful alright but why are there no recovery accounts with people that are not struggling so much reading things like it is ok to eat these days it is ok to have chocolate and so on is soooo triggering for me because yes i know i do eat and i do have chocolate constantly and all this shit is making me feel guilty for not feeling guilty you get me and my whole explore on insta is these accounts it used to be thinspo and food and even this was less triggering am i the only one that feels that way i mean of course i have negative thoughts and of course i feel guilty about eating but should i be crying about eating pasta should i be shaking while sipping hot chocolate is my ed even valid if i eat everything i want with no extreme fear,1,156
does anyone else feel stupid when you dress nicely or wear makeup i am overweight and i do not wear makeup or jewelry do my nails and so on because i feel like a clown in them like i will look stupid because i am overweight and people like me do not look good in these things but when i see other people my size wearing makeup and so on i wish i could look like them,1,77
i have been eating 3 meals a day for a couple of weeks now and my partner said its the best part of his day hearing me tell him what i ate because it brings me joy i know there is a lot of horrible boyfriends on this subreddit so i just wanted to say you guys can find someone better that will not be triggering and will support you,1,70
what is the dumbest question someone has asked about your eating disorder mine is do you hear actual voices telling you to not eat,1,24

if i had an hourglass or pear shaped body i would not feel the need to be thin i feel like if i had an hourglass or pear shaped body i would not feel the need to be thin i am so jealous of girls with the bone structure fat distribution that allow them to look so much more feminine by default than i ever will at any weight i feel like being very thin is the only way i can look feminine because my body just likes to store most of my excess fat in my stomach when i am thin i can hide the fact that i have a less feminine body type like i do not feel insecure about having no ass no tits no hips when i am skinny because skinny women are not expected to have those attributes the same way women at higher weights are when i am at a healthier weight i am not insecure about weighing more in general but just embarrassed of the way my body stores it but if my body put fat in my legs or hips or boobs or ass literally just anywhere but my stomach i would not feel so masculine and ugly and unattractive i feel like i am inherently worse and less of a woman than those with hourglass pear shaped bodies does anyone else felt similarly i have healed my relationship with food for the most part but i just cannot seem to get over my body type,1,254
dumb things your ed has made you do i recently on impulse put body lotion in my yoghurt so i could not eat it,1,24

how can you eat whatever you want and stay skinny i cannot though i obsessively plan out everything in advance i hate eating in front of people but any time i anticipate having to do it i always plan ahead so nobody gets suspicious sometimes i save all my calories for one normal meal to eat in front of everyone if i am going out i am definitely not eating whatever i want but most people who do not know me well just think i am naturally skinny at this point because i plan around social events and seeing other people so meticulously and i am in too deep to feel like i can stop or tell the truth,1,119
my bf confessed he s more attracted to me since recovery all those nights wasted crying myself to sleep fearing he would think i was fat when i was literally at my lowest weight only for him to confess he found me less attractive and thought i looked terrible since he was scared that i might literally die but he stayed because he loved me according to him i am a lot prettier and way more attractive now since recovery it might sound rude now that i m typing it out but we had an honest conversation about my ed in the past and i was relieved hearing those words this is one of the contributors that will probably make sure i won t relapse,1,125
what is the stupidest thing a medical professional has said to you relating to you are ed i will start at 13 my gender therapist told me since i was trans and suffered from gender dysphoria i could not also suffer from body dysmorphia they are conflicting diagnoses you cannot have both it is 6 years later and she was very very wrong also the fact that research suggests having dysphoria might make you more likely to have body dysmorphia,1,80
if you could eat anything no guilt no urges no body impact what would it be just sitting here after my safe healthy breakfast still hungry as usual and thinking about all the things i wish i could eat if they did not come with urges calories my top 3 would be sweet potato fries mac and cheese croissants,1,59

normal things to binge on a while ago i saw someone post that they do not binge on normal things and ig my brain decided tonight i am about to be like that too so i just binged on fucking m n ms and milk anyways let us open up the discussion what is your not normal thing to binge on edit i would love to reply to all of you but i do not have the time sorry i will try my best ty alllll,1,86
healthy weight i just saw the most triggering post where everyone was saying how someone looked like a healthy weight so they must not be sick one even said and not even on the skinny end of healthy meanwhile the girl looks like i did at my sickest it triggered me so much i cannot stop thinking about it this is why recovery is so fucking hard in this society most people think that you can tell someone is health by their size and it is just not true i have been at healthy weights without a period fuzz all over my body blue nails what is even worse is how the diagnostic criteria even goes off of this idea with atypical anorexia how do i get over this what do you all think of people talking about healthy or ideal weights even my doctor uses that term and said before that i am healthy based on my weight,1,159
what songs that are not about eating disorders make you think of yours i am curious if other people do this and if there is any logic behind the connection yesterday i was meal prepping dinner by breaking apart a can of tuna and putting it into a container while listening to music lithium by nirvana came on and something in my brain just said yeah this fits the parts about finding a god and the friends in your head in the first verse felt like how everyone talks about how their disorder is always with them and will not leave but it is ok with them since it is all they have left and the bridge naming things like like it miss you loved you killed you all followed up by i am not going to crack it just feels like how my disorder is not a problem to me and how it is just part of life and barely phases me it is just like a bad habit like forgetting to brush your teeth or letting the trash pile up also falling away from me by korn but that is lowkey a throwaway since i link that song to every problem in my life,1,206
having an ed for 5 years is an entirely different experience i think my disordered eating started when i was 12 and now i am 18 and in uni which is really weird to think about anyway i just wanted to rant about something i see these tiktoks i hate that application but the videos are on instagram now too about how a lot of people s eds i am guessing mostly young teenagers from the way they talk started in quarantine this is not surprising at all and i sympathize so much i have noticed that the way these people talk about their eating disorders is something i do not even relate to anymore because of how long i have had it like i guess i would have totally agreed with everything during the first 2 years or so of having an ed but now it is just   not the same at all as in things like constant meanspo thinspo making moodboards to motivate yourself those tumblr ish pro ana quotes edtwt etc now that i have been anorexic orthorexic whatever for this long it is all just a chore to me and basically a routine i mean i literally do not have the energy to actively romanticize any of it the way others do because it is all so boring now that it is consumed a whole third of my life i do not know if anyone else will relate unfortunately i did not manage to keep in touch with all the other ed veterans i encountered online i guess i am trying to say that the glamorous parts of having an eating disorder fade when you have had it for so many years at least for me that is,1,292
people who go out of their way to call people with ed s fatphobic suck yes it actually happens consistently tiny mention of ed behaviors fatphobia is the bias or discriminatory behaviors targeted at individuals because of their weight targeted most people are not going out of their way and saying ugh you eat like that or i could never let myself get like you they are struggling with something and if you go out of your way to call them fatphobic you are really fucked up i will be using anorexia as an example because of personal experience anorexia is more than weight it is about control and coping there is the concept however of phobia being fear the fear of gaining weight one could argue is due to the social stigmatization of obesity and because of this fear they criticize and judge overweight people this would define fatphobia but the point is the generalization as with any generalization there is certain people who do criticize overweight people and certain people who do not so to say this to quite literally every person is a shitty thing and if you do not know why i will get to that anorexia nervosa and other eds have the highest mortality suicide rate out of any mental illness to attribute something so fatal to fatphobia reduces a psychopathology to a beauty standard which is rarely ever the case it is an incredibly misunderstood disorder but please do not ever once think it is meant for vanity it is akin to telling someone who is quite about seconds from killing themselves that they are selfish it is not as if fat people cannot have an ed the use of the word is meant as derogatory to shame people for their discrimination that or it is used to educate to throw it out at random people with an ed is so childish they are going through their own struggle which i will add is insanely difficult and informing them that their fear of being overweight is wrong does not do anything and will only end up making them feel worse i keep saying them to distance myself but i have personally experienced this it is such a terrible feeling to post in edanon about your struggles and have someone come in and say you are being fatphobic and it is super problematic you need to revise your thinking it is honestly appalling the post was talking about how i threw up in the sink because i overate i said nothing about overweight people and nothing about a certain weight as per edanon rules alot of the people that make these comments have never experienced anything like what we feel they are from the outside looking in maybe it sounds like i am ranting about a single occurrence but i swearrrr i see it happen a lot short summary please do not comment something like it literally is fatphobic because you are afraid of being fat because you either did not read the whole rant or have pretty slow processing abilities that is not the point allow me to restate it just in case making a generalization that a group of people with life threatening and painful disorders that they are bad people and need to simply fix it is wrong i am not saying some people with eds do not need to work on not critiquing others as that can happen within the ed community subconsciously usually but to make an initial assumption that they are bad people is just wrong i have seen this kind of thing happen 20 times in a few months and it is really starting to piss me off now because it happened to me so that is the end,1,631
am i crazy orrrrr okay first off i am about to be 30 in feb way too old for this shit so it is kind of embarrassing to talk about but does anyone else ever kind of pretend they are like in a movie or tv show or something like when i am alone i sometimes act like i am being filmed like i try to act the way women do in movies hyper focused on the angles of my chin and if my hair is messy romanticize every little thing it is hard to explain it relates to the ed because in my fantasies i am always a tiny fragile woman can anyone relate to this or am i just nuts,1,122
does anyone else find those it is all just posing posts extremely unhelpful you know the ones with the influencer is showing side by side photos of themselves posed vs unposed to show how unrealistic instagram is like thanks i guess but my body would never look like that even if i posed that is the whole point the pose works for them because they already have an ideal body that they can then accentuate further with the right angles it just does not do anything to make me feel better in my own skin or lessen comparative thoughts if i posed like they did i would still look fat and blobby no amount of angle work is going to change that,1,122
i fucking hate cassie with all my being i did not eat for x days so i could be lovely oh please shut up already but seriously though that whole show portrayed mental illness in such a romanticized way i want to puke,1,43
my boyfriend made a disgusting joke i am in tears i was asking him to be more caring and went on to talk about how i fully relapsed because of a comment he made that he apparently did not mean and he went on to joke about how surviving on 1 2 meals is his daily implying that i am not starving myself enough this guy s 2 meals are heavy and greasy so naturally he can survive of them i am easily triggered by greasy food so my meals are more simple and small portioned and now i purge them out i just do not know what to do i feel heartbroken and triggered even more i really loved this person and j thought he is the one he went on to justify his stupid joke by saying it was just him blurting out meaningless crap because of his adhd i am not buying it at all update he dumped me,1,162
look i enjoy meanspo  but directly attacking overweight people and or posting their content and calling them disgusting girl bye i see this so commonly on edtwt where they are like eww look at those rolls makes me sick i have that shirt too posts a picture of their bones next to a picture of an overweight person wearing the same article of clothing literally tags them too like bitch you make me sick the audacity to publicly comment on someone else s body when you are not even secure with yourself and use an anime profile picture to hide the ugliness behind the screen my god you do not even have half the confidence they do yet feel as if you have the right to speak about their body in such a negative manner read some shitty quotes stop bullying people and using your i have an ed defense it is absolutely disgusting and we do not claim you and if you really want to view fat people as your own meanspo keep it to yourself we all have sick fucking thoughts but to act on them or speak of them shame on you,1,195
every fitness influencer is a liar protein powder in oatmeal is the worst thing i have consumed in my entire life i am so nauseous oh my gosh,1,28
reddits response to recovery posts makes me sick there is one of those before after anorrxia posts on the front page right now plenty of lovely comments of people telling this young woman congrats on beating anorexia i am proud of you you look amazing but if you scroll through the comments too long you get the disgusting people questioning if she was even underweight before calling her fat calling her attention seeking i only read for five minutes and i lost my appetite for the day i am disgusted and depressed and i hate that those lowlifes made me feel anything at all,1,104
i cannot stop thinking about the random bulimia line from to the bone it went something like i have bulimia nervosa though nowadays it is more nervosa than bulimia what the fucdkjdk whose idea was that,1,36
someone hit on my husband and she was thinner than me ran up to him to give him her card and then ran away i stood speechless before blurting out i am his wife be right back restricting until i hit my ugw ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,1,44
why do we all crave nut butters so much i see here that there is a recurring theme that a lot of people crave peanut butter while restricting what is the science behind this i broke my fast just now over a damned jar of almond butter and a cup of unsweetened almond milk and it just feels way too damn good to stop i might just eat half the jar by the spoonful update that jar of almond butter just triggered a binge,1,84
does anyone else get really scared when hearing the sentiment of course you look thin now wait until you are 30 and we will talk i even saw it on a post here with a fair amount of upvotes and i was like fuck it is real then ed bitches often call out diet culture bullshit people always say that it is really easy to stay skinny in your 20s and i get really scared because i work my ass off to even get semi skinny it is the opposite of easy for me it makes me think that when i am older staying skinny is going to be fucking impossible and i really do not want to open that can of worms so i have not had that mental breakdown yet,1,132
a nurse told me that anorexia is not a mental health disorder in australia what did i miss when i was recently being registered in aussie hotel quarantine nurse interviewed me regarding my health she asked me if i have a history of mental health disorders and i told her i had anorexia for 6 years in the past now doing better she laughed and said oh honey eating disorder is not a mental health issue and she stopped there i am from europe and i graduated psych does anyone have any idea about these medical views i specifically said i have been struggling with anorexia for more than six years and relapsed once and i highly doubt she thought that i was referring to a loss of appetite just because i did not say nervosa it was a health screening interview not a medical conference debate thanks everyone for the support being in quarantine for 2 weeks was a major trigger considering the inability to do any physical activity and constant food delivery,1,174
i just got jealous looking at a camel s legs they were so skinny what the fuck,1,17
christmas is tomorrow so just a reminder its okay you will be okay i know its hard i know it is really hard but you will be alright you guys are all amazing and i am so proud of you it is okay to eat its okay to celebrate and it may feel hard but its okay to relax when you can you do not need to work off those christmas calories your body deserves fuel and you are allowed to eat it is okay you are okay feel free to vent in the comments if you want i will do my best to reply to everyone i am here for you guys as are so many other people we have got this,1,123
i am scared that as a short woman i will never be able to have a healthy relationship with food i do not even know what that looks like i have never had a good relationship with food for various reasons i used to just have a problem with binging but i have become very good at restricting i go through periods of being able to eat a normal diet mostly when i am pregnant breastfeeding but the problem is i am 5 2 and i have always been overweight or obese and i am trying to get to a healthy weight not super skinny i do not want to see bones i do not want to see ribs i just want to be in the healthy range not even the lower range of that but the problem is i will i ever get there it is such a slippery slope with the 1200 cal and working out and religiously tracking because a lot of people say you are only one a little over what is the big deal when someone goes over the 1200 and it is like for sure people it actually can be a huge deal going over even a small amount can just completely undo the work i did for a couple of days because i am on such a short margin here and i always will be i have calculated and even when i hit my goal weight my tdee is going to be 1600 or so at most of course i can always try and have a more active lifestyle but with two kids and all kinds of life responsibilities i do not know how i am going to be able to be active enough to be able to eat what i consider a normal amount of food my husband is only 2 inches taller than me and his almost tdee is double mine and that is not even when he is being really active that is just on an average day how am i ever going to have a normal relationship with food how am i ever going to be able to eat normally if i am not doing something whether it is religious counting or a lot of exercise or fasting even though i kind of hate it i feel like a lot of people just do not understand the struggle it is to be a short person because it is not just about the ed thing it is also about trying to be healthy and you know be around for my kids for as long as i can so i am at a weight that does not affect my health negatively and it just feels like there is always going to be this struggle and i am always going to tow this line even if i am in a healthy good place it feels like i am always going to have to have some form of eating issue if i want to stay healthy i do not know i guess this is just kind of stream of thought venting and seeing if anybody else understands or feels the same way,1,529
if i knew this is how i would look i would not have recovered big trigger warning for very anti recovery thinking on my part and internalized fatphobia i do not want to discourage anyone from recovery but holy shit if i knew this was how i would look on the other side i would not have done it i look disgusting double chin weight all congregated to my center so i look like some misshapen blob i can hardly clear a flight of stairs without being winded everything jiggles and none of my clothing even my pre ed clothing fits it is like my treatment team s goal was to make me overweight like a punishment for having an eating disorder this is not weight restoration this is fattening up i do not feel healthier in fact i feel actively unhealthier in this body and i am completely repulsed by it i have never had body image this poor i feel humiliated being in my own skin i feel weak and judged and i do not want to go anywhere because i am horrified that people have to look at me i am in a treatment facility so there is nothing i can really do about this right now but you can be your asses i will be exercising and restricting once i am released i regret coming into treatment so much i cannot stand the sight of myself i do not even recognize my face and i am furious that they have done this to me had i known this is how far they would take packing pounds onto me i would not have agreed to come to recovery i do not plan on even coming close to maintaining this body once i leave which thankfully is in a few short weeks and the worst part is they are still weight restoring me this body still is not big enough for them i am enraged i am repulsed i hate my body and hate that i have allowed them to do this to me,1,346
i just ate my entire advent calendar something in me snapped and i had this insane primal urge to just eat i have been hungry for so long and there was nothing here but some fruit and an advent calendar my mom gave me i ate it all and i actually feel good and full for once but now i have no advent calendar,1,64
does anyone else feel like their eating disorder prevents them from other serious addictions like if weed did not make me eat everything in sight i would be a total stoner but i absolutely do not want to deal with the munchies so i avoid it if alcohol was not so high calorie and triggered drunchies i would drink way more but i am basically sober like the only thing i really intake is caffeine small saving graces i guess,1,80
on a scale of 1 to 10 how bloated do you all get when you eat,1,16
farewell 2 years is enough for me christmas is here and i want to get better my grandma passed away a few days ago she wanted me to get better i do not want to be anorexic anymore now i have experienced it and that is enough i am sick enough i have been sick long enough i am underweight enough i do not want to be anorexic for my whole life anymore i am done with this wishing you all a happy safe christmas,1,85
i believe my wife has an eating disorder again i apologize for the length but i am trying to figure out if i am understanding things properly i am not a doctor and i probably have a lot wrong here i am here asking for help in understanding how things went wrong x200b when we first met she was very thin she was approximately 125 pounds at 5 11 this is a bmi of 17 4 and to my knowledge is considered underweight she eventually disclosed that it was the result of an eating disorder and that she had been even thinner she never called it anorexia but just referred to it as an eating disorder x200b part of what created our relationship is that when we met i was super active weight trained and was generally rather athletic so i had to eat a lot i helped her obtain a better diet start working out biking and working towards a more sustainable lifestyle within a year the results where evident she was at a normal bmi and she was much more healthy and her personality was amazing we eventually got married x200b after our first two pregnancies she put on about 80 100 pounds reaching about 240 pounds each time destroyed her self image made her depressed and she aggressively tried to lose weight she did exercise but also did a lot of intermittent fasting sometimes losing 8 10 pounds in a month for several months in a row x200b with these first two pregnancies she never really got back down to her target weight and remained depressed about it however she did exercise we were more active and i ultimately never recognized any red flags x200b after our third and last pregnancy her weight maxed out again and she was as depressed as ever she often stated resentment towards me for getting her pregnant and that i made her fat stating this would be her last pregnancy she aggressively started trying to lose weight so she could be skinny again x200b she has hashimoto s disease which is extreme hypothyroidism without medication synthroid and proper diet she will endure a massive hormonal imbalance symptom s of thyroid hormone imbalance include extreme anxiety fatigue brain fog mood swings and depression along with a slowed metabolism which exacerbates weight gain not weight loss even with synthroid without a proper diet it is well documented that these symptoms will occur she is simply not a candidate for extreme fasting for weight loss as it would throw her hormones out of balance much more so than a woman without the disease x200b with my wife now working at home because of covid and isolated in her home office all day unable to go the gym and exercise due to covid fears she became very depressed had more unexpected mood swings and constantly complained of fatigue unable to lose weight she started stacking caffeine pills and bronkaid which has ephedrine the combination acts as an appetite suppressant and gives energy needed due to lack of food x200b i believe this routine began the start of a new eating disorder for days at a time she would not eat breakfast lunch or even a snack and would have only a small meal at dinner omad the combination of stimulants and hashimoto s induced hormonal imbalance due to poor diet predictably created an array of behavioral issues depression threats of self harm anger dramatic mood swings and fatigue that made her less available to help with the kids x200b these behavioral issues reached a point where we found ourselves in marriage counseling and the therapist a psychologist and i discussing with her present the possibility of taking her to the hospital she refused but the therapist suggested she go see a psychiatrist immediately i believe she was in denial about her new eating disorder and consistently stated she believed her fatigue and brain fog was due to a previous diagnosis of adhd and autism x200b upon seeing a psychiatrist she was prescribed adderall which is an amphetamine and a damn good appetite suppressant her behavior became dramatically worse she persisted in including caffeine often drinking a tall cup of coffee and taking a caffeine pill around noon all while not eating anything all day until dinner time x200b she began losing weight very fast she called adderall a magic pill that it worked like magic and helped her focus at work while allowing her to lose weight however her mood swings reached an extreme level and anytime i tried to confront her even something as simple as offering lunch she would get combative and defensive she would essentially accuse me of trying to keep her fat and sabotaging her weight loss because i did not want her to be attractive again and lose her x200b it is well documented that adderall when used while depressed can lead to manic behavior it is well documented that adderall when used as an appetite suppressant can lead to anorexia x200b i contacted her psychiatrist and complained while they would not talk about her specifically for privacy reasons i was told they would not prescribe adderall to anybody with a history of eating disorders and if a patient had disclosed hashimoto s which the symptoms can present as adhd like they would not prescribe adderall in that case either they basically told me she likely was not honest about her symptoms and her history in order to get the prescription they also said that in this situation both anorexia and psychotic behavior would be a predictable outcome and she should stop taking it immediately x200b as the weight loss and adderall use persisted we were constantly fighting she would erupt over mundane issues often in front of the kids which over time resulted in me having to leave the home because i refused to be drawn into a baseless fight with the children present simply going to another room would not help as she would follow me and keep fighting x200b she is now skinny mean abusive a total bully and she is physically attacked me while i was holding one of our kids knocked us both down and in front of the other kids she has threatened to kill my cat on multiple occasions i do not know who this person is she hates me with a passion for trying to interfere with her weight loss and to say our marriage is in ruins is an understatement do i understand what is happening is there anything wrong with my layman s analysis i love my wife but am at a total loss of how to get her help and repair things,1,1123
does hunger make you feel high,1,6
i scared myself today i was wearing a low cut shirt and i saw my ribcage through my skin in the mirror i did not know i looked so bad i felt awful i do not even look human at this point i immediately called a friend and asked if she ever saw my ribcage through my skin or if i am just being paranoid and she said that i have looked like that for a long time but she did not want to bring it up and potentially trigger me so i have been walking around like that this whole time and i refused to see it because i thought i looked good but i am built like christian bale in the machinist it is not cute it is like my brain glitched out for a moment and instead of seeing the romanticized version of myself that my ed wants me to see i saw what i actually look like from a normal perspective,1,165
what is the best advice and so on you have heard about eds and i am not talking about the do not count calories count memories kind of thing not that those quotes are bad but what piece of advice talk whatever really got you not even that it immediately made you chose recovery but just a thing that had you thinking,1,62
do anyone else s boobs trigger their ed i am a cis f and my boobs make me hate myself and it adds onto my ed i guess it is just because i want to be small in all aspects when i was underweight and had no boobs i joked around about wanted boobs but i guess i never knew how bad it was going to make me feel about myself,1,71
how do you all stay warm i cannot seem to fight the bone deep chill i hate wearing sweatpants and pajamas all the time but the alternative is cranking the heat and making everyone else uncomfortable not sure how i am going to survive when winter hits here,1,48
merry christmas eve i hyped myself up all month to eat my dad s christmas soufflé i knew he was bringing to my house today and guess what i did it merry christmas,1,33
losing weight was the best thing to ever happen to me tw this post is insanely triggering for numerous reasons i acknowledge how disordered these thoughts are and i am going to therapy twice a week to work through them i understand if this gets removed laughing out loud also i have severe adhd so this post is probably all over the place i am so sorry i 21f grew up overweight and in high school i became known for being thicc and it became a large part of my identity then i gained even more weight after high school and i started selling nudes less than a month after i turned 18 and i made so much money because i was so fetishized for being fat i got constant hate and harassment online for my weight and any time i met a boy in real life he would just use me for sex and treat me like shit i felt so ashamed of my body i completely isolated myself for years and did not have a job or friends in february 2020 i got a retail job and then got put on furlough because of covid in april 2020 since i had so much free time and those insane unemployment checks i decided i was going to finally get my shit together and start trying to lose weight i bought a 50 smart scale that connects to an application on your phone so you can track you are weight loss and i paid 150 to sign up for noom which claims to be an anti diet application lmao and it told me i should be eating 1200 calories a day or less at this point i had a bmi of 39 5 of course this spiraled into severe anorexia and long story short i ended up reaching a bmi of 22 1 by july 2021 losing around 100lbs i would always hear people say that losing weight will not make you happier or actually make much a difference in your life and honestly that is fucking bullshit laugh my ass off yes the fuck it does i think i only feel this way because i have always held such value to someone is appearance and there is so many parts of our society that just scream that being fat is the worst thing that could ever happen to you i am also wildly self obsessed mostly due to the body dysmorphia and multitude of other mental health issues so i spend hours a day staring at myself in the mirror and hundreds of dollars a month on clothes and all i ever wanted my entire fucking life was to lose weight and i never thought i would actually get to experience what it is like being small i was always the fat friend the thicc bitch someone who is body size had apparently deemed them unworthy of basic respect i was invisible now employees at clothing stores call me tiny and my family calls me boney and i am treated like a real human being for the first time in my life i used to only be able to shop in the men s tshirt section at thrift stores but now i can actually put together cute outfits and i can fit into everything and i never knew i had such beautiful bone structure every day when i wake up and see my small body in the mirror it feels like waking up on christmas morning i would relive every terrible thing that is ever happened to me if it meant getting to have the body i do right now i know this is an awful way of thinking and i should not feel this way but i have never heard anyone else that understands and i cannot talk about this anywhere or with anyone without sounding like an annoying self centered bragging bitch i feel guilty for loving my skinny body so fucking much because if i heard a skinny bitch say any of this while i was at my heaviest i would have beat her ass and then went home and cried when i was fat i could have constantly posted i love being thicc or i have such a juicy fat ass but now that i am small it would be inappropriate for me to post things like i love having a tiny waist or my collarbones look so cute right now and that is frustrating i do not even know where i am going with this rant but i have been thinking about this nonstop for days and i am so high right now and i needed to type this out,1,786
i know i should not be surprised my ed friends keep dying but it does not make it hurt less this is the third friend i have lost this month and i am feeling really overwhelmed and alone i know this disease has one of the top mortality rates of mental illness but it never gets easier to hear that i have lost someone else it does not help that her mom keeps telling everyone she took the easy way out and commit suicide how could she hurt her family like that it is so selfish my friend was assaulted at a young age and i guarantee you starving yourself to death over the grief of losing your childhood is not the easy way out she asked for help so many times and her family acted like it was her choice to not eat and denied the abuse happened my other friends both died from complications from heart problems one of them had a heart attack fainted while driving and her car hit someone else they are fine but the article about her said mentally ill teen causes crash absolutely disgusting an ed is not just the latest way people are killing them selves there is much more to it and more kinds of ed s than just starvation reducing my friends entire lives to selfish and mentally ill ignores all their beauty their creativity the nights we stayed up laughing until we cried and the future that they could have had if this disease was not dismissed as a choice,1,261
please god why did my friend just text me her under weight out of the blue omgggg this is the lowest she is been in a while it is so hard to gain weight oh my god i am so skinny people keep telling me how jealous they are dog you know i am anorexic i literally do not care anyway we are the same weight but she is 3 inches taller than me so that is pretty sick and definitely not making me want to die,1,87
for those of us who binge why do you think we overeat binge when we feel fat i am asking while i indulge in several things from taco bell and a sweet ass crepe that i bought with money i should not be spending it just does not make any sense but it is an impulse i get and that i have to satisfy,1,64
do you guys base your gw on anything mine is just arbitrary i think curious to know about others thoughts,1,20
is it weird my safe foods tend to be things like chicken nuggets and pizza rolls they are not white cheddar rice cakes or anything but i love how easy it is to just count how many i am making for when i am obsessively tracking calories,1,47
emily in paris is triggering af lily collins clearly is not recovered at all and in the second season she looks so skinny and her dainty little outfits do not make this better at all i do not need this shit at christmas time which is already triggering as is it makes me so angry how lily flaunts her clearly underweight body who bets that her luscious hair is a wig she does not even have a healthy skin color wtf i am so annoyed,1,85
once again i am saying it safe foods make no fricking sense why is my ed totally fine with a egg cheese bagel sandwich and small peppermint mocha iced coffee from dunkin but an egg and cheese sandwich and iced coffee that i could make at home for half the calories was unacceptable,1,53
what is your favorite unhelpful advice words of wisdom from others mine is but you are so pretty cannot you see that and just eat something for me,1,28
does anyone else have fantasies about being locked in a room and left to starve i am well aware this is fucked lol i sometimes fantasise about being locked in an ensuite bedroom with gym equipment and unlimited fluids and lax maybe having a weekly drop of my safe foods and or being allowed to b p once a week and my food order of choice is dropped off to me this would go on until i reach a certain weight and i cannot leave before then i tend to think more about this when i am going through a bad binging spell or when i am stuck in a rutt and struggling to get ahold of things i also think about much darker things such as developing illnesses that would because rapid weight loss or being kidnapped and worse,1,140
did anyone else envy victoria justice s body type growing up,1,11
a guy accused me of photoshopping my nudes here is the paragraph he sent me after saying my not safe for work posts made him cringe and me asking why i am so upset i literally starve in fear of not being feminine enough now men tell me shit like this and accuse me of using image manipulation i do not even know how to photoshop losing body fat literally makes my hourglass figure more pronounced i know it but this message stressed me out so much because what if it is true what if the problem will forever be my bone structure and i can diet all i want i will always be scientifically unattractive it got to me so much it is pathetic but jesus,1,127
i wish i could starve myself in peace sometimes without the obligation of schoolwork brain fog work exhaustion and parents will punish me if i lose my period again maybe just exist for a few months without obligations to those things and destroy my body with no regards to anything just wanted to ramble,1,54
emily in paris s2 is out and i forgot how ridiculously triggering this show is 12 minutes into episode 1 and i have thought more about food and my body than i did this entire past week lily collins is literally the tiniest,1,43
does anyone else feel so defeated when they have to eat something because they were feeling faint sick not good,1,20
woah i am so mentally ill do you all ever have small realizations or like epiphanies where it just hits you how disordered you are like yesterday i was at a store and this really thin girl walked in and i consciously walked around the aisles that she was also at to like trigger myself and make myself feel bad just cannot believe how fucked up is this illness,1,69
you can count calories fast and not have an ed i get so frustrated when i see people saying that dieting and fasting are ed they are ed behaviours but not ed people count calories because they have goals they want to look a certain realistic way others fast for religious reasons or because they are convinced it is healthy for them it is unfair to project our struggles on other people s lifestyle choices that is all thanks for reading laughing out loud,1,84
what is the stupidest thing you feel invalid for i will go first even though i purge i never get the famous scratched knuckles i do not particularly understand how people even do but that makes me feel hella invalid,1,40
does anyone else get kind of annoyed seeing calories are on me today posts i understand that they are there because original poster was trying to make people feel better but to me it does not help because i know that the calories are still going to affect me the same way as they would any other day tell me in comments if i need to change the flair,1,69

anyone else lose weight but look the same really sucks because it makes me want to restrict more,1,18
is anyone else s ed all over the place i have been a restricter i have been a binger i have abused laxatives i have purged the symptoms are never consistent though like maybe for a year i restrict then a year i can eat semi normal then for a few months i binge and use laxatives here and there but it never gets bad enough that i put myself in serious danger it is just that i have an overall complicated relationship with food to be honest i am not even formally diagnosed with an ed because i cannot really be honest about my symptoms with my mental health professionals,1,111
what are your favorite soups i love soup so much i could live off of it probably what soup brands flavors etc do you recommend i live in the us by the way preferably some that are not really expensive also lol i love broccili cheddar and tomato soup,1,49
calories do not scare me anymore i am actually really set on recovery right now and it is so good been finding myself searching for higher calorie meals snacks so i can gain and recover faster and the higher calorie numbers are not that scary winning,1,46
how long have you had an ed for i initially got my ed about 8 years ago now at that time i suffered for just over a year before my body gave up and i went into recovery i have suffered with disordered behaviour since over exercising binge eating a lot lapsing many times and finally fully relapsing 10 months ago i was diagnosed with b p anorexia 5 6 months ago i am not sure if that diagnosis is accurate anymore how long has your ed gone on for i hope this ends for all of us soon edit thank you for responding everyone this was an interesting general consensus there are a lot more long term sufferers here than i thought i just wanted to say have faith i have hope for you all to get better i hope you find the light at the end of the tunnel,1,151
traumatic er experience i have been ed symptom free for 1 year after taking zoloft this year i have gained a lot of weight after hitting my ugw last year being in the overweight category this year has been triggering upsetting and overall bad but i have pushed through it because i want to recover i have been talking to my haes doctor and therapists to ensure i do not relapse recently i have gone off zoloft and am on a different med and with the help of my dietitian we are going to see where my body should be without constant starvation and medication messing with me that being said i am still in this artificially larger body i went to my plastic surgeon for my one year follow up i got an abdominoplasty after hitting my ugw last year and she remarked on my weight gain with zoloft she was really nice about it not triggering at all and mentioned my stomach which is crazy distended with some examination she revealed that i actually have a hernia she told me to go to a surgeon i have an appointment wednesday i was in a lot of pain yesterday and went to the er as dr google said i should with a hernia the doctor there refused to examine me he said my stomach was fat i told him what my surgeon said and he said he knew what fat looked like and would not do a physical examination of me he offered me morphine then sent me on my way i am still in pain i have been restricting ever since i have not been in a body this large before i have never experienced medical neglect because of my body before i have never been fat i have been all sizes of middling and chunky and skinny and tiny but i have never been fat i have been awesome with my therapists and dietitians and i do not binge or eat wrong but this medication has destroyed my self image and this doctor has crushed me i could just use support,1,354
what caused a safe food to stop being a safe food used to love chobani yogurt and justin s almond butter cannot eat either brand because i started binging on them for like 2 weeks and they are ruined forever also those zero calorie vitamin waters and powerades just awful,1,50
aita for not wanting to meet my friend because her emaciated body triggers me i will not tell her that i will not give her ed voice the satisfaction of knowing that she is thin enough to trigger others i will not do that but i will find every excuse to not meet her for my own well being i just cannot look at her without feeling like i am a gross disgusting pig for eating while she brags about her drug use and weight loss i will not meet her no matter how many times she asks me it seems like she is proud of herself how skinny and the amount of meds she is on and i do not think i can criticize that i would rather let her think that i just do not want to see her than tell her the truth am i just an ass who thinks too much about herself she randomly says how much she weighs and then apologizes for triggering me and it is like that every time edit why am i still friends with her i acknowledge that she does not really have anybody else i am afraid she will hurt herself if i leave and i do kind of care about her well being i want her to get better i am just fed up with her shit and wanted to get some advice on how to end things peacefully because i have never dealt with a situation like this,1,251
daily reminder that your ed can and will kill you at any weight and no amount of flintstones gummy vitamins will prevent that for context i went from bmi 24 8 to bmi 18 6 in the span of a few months my mom made me go to the doctor it turns out that my standing heart rate is 53 bpm they told me that if it drops below 50 bpm i am at risk of organ failure i also have a low white blood cell count i did everything right i high restricted took a shitton of vitamins and drank tons of water yet i still ended up in this situation even though i am not underweight they are still threatening to hospitalize me if i lose more one of my biggest fears is being forced to recover before i hit my ugw and now it is actually happening to me i still panicked and stress ate 3 000 calories today though fuck my life,1,166
is anyone else completely uneffected by societal standards of beauty except for when it comes to thinness i never wear make up except for when i am formally required to i do not care about fashion trends there are some details about my face that i absolutely dislike but i have learned to make peace with that and i do not try to hide them i have stretch marks on my hips but i am not insicure about that at all i am completely comfortable with people seeing me in sweatpants and pyjama but i absolutely cannot tolerate the idea of being seen in public unless my body is at the shape that i want it to be and i feel like i cannot function properly unless my body looks a certain way and it is so contradictory because how can i ignore most beauty standards so much but then be completely obsessed with the idea of being thin why am i free from all of societal expectations when it comes to physical appearance except for this one eating disorders are su weird i stg,1,185
i have never been so triggered in my life my little sister just came home from college and her body is so perfect wtf literally she seems to just intuitively eat the exact correct amount of food and never exercises and she just looks like that she has such a beautiful hourglass figure with a defined waist and boobs that are big but not too big this is literally my ideal body i have giant boobs that sag all the way to my waistline because of my weight loss and my waistline is a blob literally it is probably five more inches around than hers i do not even know we are the exact same height thinspo does not usually work for me but all i have to do is look at her and i immediately have the urge to walk for eight hours and never eat again she is so fucking happy and her life is so perfect with her internships and her perfect relationship and here i am completely alone never even kissed anyone about to graduate with zero work experience absolutely miserable this ed is all i have and she is better at it without even trying i want to jump off a bridge,1,207
is it possible to spot others with an ed okay so at my work there is this girl who always gets the same as me on break usually just a coffee and a fruit bag and goes on a walk the whole break like me our shifts are 8 hours bear in mind and everyone else there gets a full meal on their breaks the thing is no one at my work suspects me or her to have an ed or at least no one s said anything but the other day she made a comment she said at least i am not the only one who hates food in this place talking to me if that is not calling me out aswell as her on our eds i do not know what is since starting there i feel like i have known she has an ed without even having to speak to her anyone else think we can spot things others do not even think to look for,1,169
i was downvoted for saying victoria s secret models do not give people eds basically the title i basically said hey eds mostly stem from trauma and the need for control pop culture can be a part of it but no one gets eds from women on tv and saying that is disrespectful to people with eds and the women you are blaming and i got downvoted for it people are so ridiculous that they think someone is wrong for saying a mental illness is not caused by skinny women on television but trauma and a need for control we live in a society edit i made this post last night and i just woke up i have had some time to think about everything and i get what a lot of you are saying i understand that some of my statements were very extreme and i am sorry i still do find it unlikely that vs models by themselves not coupled with societal pressure and extreme standards are the sole causes of eds but i understand that everyone is story is different and valid i did not mean to invalidate or brush anyone off and i am sorry,1,199
why is the white sugar free monster so good whyyyyyy,1,10
do you agree with haes i know this is a controversial topic but i am curious about different opinions some say that haes does not mean healthy at every size but it means that one can engage in health promoting behaviors at every size i agree that one can engage in health promoting behaviors at any size like exercising eating a balanced diet etc but it feels like some influencers particularly on instagram promote haes as healthy as every size and claiming that they are healthy at 600 lbs i know we cannot judge someone is health based on their size but weight is not a totally useless metric of health is it just because someone is technically medically healthy now at a very high weight does not mean they will be healthy later on of course i do not have any medical knowledge but can one really be healthy at every size being very underweight or obese is likely not healthy some say that they are naturally very large large as in 500 pounds i know bodies come in all shapes and sizes but how is being that overweight natural would not it be caused by external factors like consistent overeating just because it is natural does not mean it is healthy just like how being very underweight naturally is not healthy i feel like some have misinterpreted the haes movement and turned it into something it is not or maybe i just do not understand it all bodies deserve respect no matter how big or small but it is difficult to believe that one can be morbidly obese and that it is not harmful to their health short term and long term i have been wondering about this topic as i see a lot of content about ed recovery and haes what bothers me the most is that some of these haes treatment providers say that the key to recovery is dismantling by internalized fatphobia or whatever yes fatphobia is harmful but i do not think that approach works for everyone and promote gaining weight in recovery even if it is not needed or might not be healthy for the person in order to get rid of the fear of weight gain and learn to love their larger body this might just be me and my ed fearing weight gain though can we share opinions in a civilized manner plz in the comments,1,405
ed farts are literally lethal man maybe it is just my fucked up digestive system but it does not matter whether i have restricted purged or binged it is horrible please tell me someone else relates,1,36
how do people do that how do you eat how do you love your body how do you not worry about what your eating just how do you do that i want to be like that so bad so so bad,1,41
what is with people with ed s drinking white monsters what does it mean can someone explain,1,17
is sweating like crazy related to ed i ate a normal meal yesterday night after not eating almost anything for a long time when i went to bed i woke up at 3am and was sweating like crazy like i was wetting the bed from sweat my hair was wet from sweat too my ac was on but still i was so fcking hotttttt i drank some water that was beside me and went back to sleep some time after i woke up again and was still so hot still sweating my room was cold af is it related to my ed,1,102
does anyone else have random fuck my ed meals basically like a random meal you eat because you are hungry so normal eating lol like last night i would already had three small meals but i was really hungry because i went for a long run so i had some chocolate peanut butter oatmeal i even added extra dark chocolate chips and did not measure the pb it was probably pretty high cal but it was also decently healthy and i did not regret it when i went to sleep the weird thing though is the next morning today i was straight back to restricting it is like whatever mini glimpse of recovery i had went away,1,117
any one else feel addicted to this sub and other ed subs its literally my biggest source of procrastination i think its the perfect mixture of focusing on my ed and social media for my brain to just be consumed by it like i will be trying to do work and next minute i am back here scrolling i know if i did not have these subs i would just be looking at whatever other ed content i could find but still i wish i could just ask how do i not think about my ed and focus on something else but i know its not that simple because its part of the disorder i just hate it so much because ill be scrolling here for a while then realise i am doing it again fuck that is also part of the reason i have never really understood people who do not know they have an eating disorder i know it happens and eds are very different for people but i am so aware of it all that i cannot imagine not thinking about it all of the time,1,189
ok am i being a snowflake or does anyone else find it weird that if your dangerously overweight your morbidly obese but if your dangerously underweight your severely underweight,1,29
tasty protein what is everyone is favorite protein snacks meals to make i need stuff that tastes good and that is creative because i do not want to eat the same stuff everyday i want to branch out you know plus muscle sadly needs protein to grow blah blah blah,1,50
i went through my ana journal i kept at 12 and oh my do i have some opinions first of all darling you do not actually like green tea you despise it and no it does not make you vomit because you are blessed by the ana godess you are just sensitive to tanines second of all girl one apple a day will keep the doctor away only if you keep it down and pair it with some protein or like actual nutrition also that pink salt water cleanse girl who did you this dirty so you feel like you have to put yourself through that jumping jacks are overrated if you skip dinner you will not wake up thinner you will wake up hungry and grumpy wrapping yourself with plastic membrane will not starve your fat cells the gollum is not thinspo saying to your friends that you have not eaten in days will not make them believe you are strong willed it will make them sad pretty girls do eat gum is only making your acid reflux worse it does not curb your appetite eating raw chicken to get sick will not be fun you will also somehow never get sick doing that somehow that does not make you immune it makes you lucky you need therapy not tape worms you do not like rice cakes your mum is not trying to make you fat she is trying to keep you alive something you fail at doing yourself you do not like black coffee you are just sleep deprived and last for now puking up stomach acid is not a sign of your fat burning to the ground it is a sign you need to stop fasting,1,289
how many others here got their eds from their dads i feel the stereotype is that people get eds from their moms but i got most of my ed habits from my dad like he would constantly talk about how overweight he is even when he is not and would go on week long fasts it was especially bad near holidays and his birthday he would obsess over hitting a goal weight before his birthday or holidays,1,77
the fact that i would have reached a goal weight by now if i stuck to healthy weight loss will i now take this as a sign to up my calories to prevent binges no,1,35
wandering the aisles tw disordered behavior i just had the most disordered walk through target ever i have been struggling finding something i can allow myself to eat today anything that sounds good and is not just pure sugar ok mochi candy but still unhealthy i went out to trader joe s but of course they were out of the cauliflower gnocchi i was looking for so i stopped by target on my way home i proceeded to wander down the protein bar aisle checking calorie counts on like six different things then over to the christmas snack aisle where i poked a few packages then back over to the ice cream to stare at halo tops then i picked up a box of sugar free fudgsicles and headed to the fruit where i picked up a small bag of grapes and then put the popsicles back then back up to the protein bars where i tried to talk myself into getting one of those quest bar mini protein things checked the calories on like all available options picked one up and pretty much just started at it until i put it back and went to go check out i just wanted to rant about how stupid i feel for this to some people that may understand if you read it thanks tldr wandered target and stared at calories,1,229
do most people have undiagnosed eating disorders i do not know i just do not understand how people especially women can not have eating disorders especially with how appearance focused and fatphobic our society is i see a lot of people complaining about their binges humble bragging about how little they ate in a day etc and i just wonder do most people suffer from eating disorders,1,67
oh my goodness get out of the kitchen my family will not leave the kitchen i just want to grab a slice of pumpkin pie without somebody making a comment,1,30

what sport s did you do growing up and was it triggering to you,1,14
tumblr is drunk tw vent about weight and tags so i am obese grade 2 obesity according to charts suitable for my already hefty shape binges landed me unable to purchase clothes anywhere but obscure shops online not to mention numerous health issues i used to find pretty good tips on curbing binges and sh urges on tumblr a lot of blogs and tags are now gone looking them up returns a message from tumblr asking if you are doing okay today i stumbled across a tag glorifying obesity no censorship no warning no pop up message for a website jumping everyone is throats for any semblance of eds or nudity tumblr seems eerily okay with very explicit images available on that tag and a whole lot of feeder content and feeder related tags call me a bigot but as an obese person i find it sickening on the same level as i found guys encouraging anorexics to starve just because they were into extreme malnourishment sickening do not glorify this slow suicide give it the same treatment as the other side of the spectrum you have chased off your platform taking down blogs looking for support in their recovery just because my sickness is not your fetish or aesthetic if you are going to turn a blind eye at it why not welcome not safe for work artists back i hate this double standard i hate that it is a thing sorry i just had to vent reddit is the only place i have left for it,1,258
later losers p i am in treatment and you guys just scare me now byeeeeeeeeeeee,1,15
which one of you all bought out all the fiber one brownie bars at my local store i know it was you i want a confession,1,26
haha laughing out loud i was trying to recover but now i am on a trip with two people who just do not eat i do not get it they just do not care about eating yesterday we ate lunch at 2pm and then just did not eat for the rest of the day i asked if anyone wanted to get dinner before we went out to bars and they said no because we were running late so i was like okay well i cannot drink on an empty stomach and they were like it will be fine 4 drinks later i am crying on the street about how no one eats and a stranger bought me falafel because he felt bad for me they said we will eat more today but i do not know the past two days i tried to eat protein bars and chips to keep myself going but it is really tempting to just be like ok no eating got it and just not drink and i will be fine,1,175
share with me the saddest birthday you have had my birthday is coming up in a few days and i do not know how i feel about it i want to be alone but it is awkward being alone infront of your family,1,43
anyone else hate it when they have to share their safe foods i spend a lot of time and or money making buying my safe foods on the weekends so that in case i get the urge to binge i have low calorie alternatives to binge on i do not have an issue offering people food in general or sharing food if anything i like doing that but my safe foods are a line i do not want anyone to cross i get pretty defensive and visibly irritated whenever someone comes up to me asking me for some and then if i refused they would question my generosity and how much i truly like them which is even more frustrating can anyone else relate,1,124
i just blocked my pro ana coach i am freaking out i feel so guilty i have already been struggling so much recently with my mood and i just do not need them telling me to do 10000 steps everyday when i just do not have the energy please someone tell me it is okay not to do 10000 steps a day i feel lazy,1,65
binged and purged on someone else s christmas present just binged and purged on an expensive box of chocolates which were supposed to be a christmas present for someone i would even wrapped them and everything to avoid the temptation so now i have to go and replace them jesus christ update thank you everyone for your kind words and support i have just replaced the chocolates and they are now under the tree and that is where they are staying,1,81
what are your thoughts on all in recovery,1,8
low restricting is easier than high restricting i know it would be more sustainable to high restrict i know i would still lose weight if i ate significantly more calories but it is like once i cross a certain threshold of food i just cannot stop and i will binge and binge and binge until suddenly i have eaten over double my maintenance and i have gained actual fat so instead i low restrict and feel like shit all the time but hey at least i do not have the urge to binge except i am not actually losing any weight because every week or two i break and end up binging back my entire deficit so i just repeatedly gain and lose the same 5 10 pounds wooooo,1,129
100 days ago i stopped counting calories after 3 years straight of doing so i had been counting all calories for over 3 years straight and by straight i mean every single day on the day my grandpa died on my graduation my last three birthdays my brother s birth i even logged the calories of the juice i was given at the hospital when i woke up from my attempt i went through 3 different phones and 5 different apps i was a slave so 100 days ago i went into inpatient treatment for a month and got everything taken away no phone internet etc so i just stopped counting that day my last logged meal was my breakfast before packing my stuff for the hospital inpatient was not exactly the best i do not even consider myself to be actively recovering anymore but one thing that i will always be grateful of was how bluntly it made me stop counting calories the 3 weeks after inpatient had been the best days of the last few years but even though i have gone downhill since then i really hope i never go back to counting calories it may not be a big step uphill but i refuse to go back to the way i was i remember when my mum had to go to the hospital for a panic attack and i logged 1 2 of the sandwich i was eating because her attack happened in the middle of dinner or when i was eating outside and while my sister s friend was crying about her mum having cancer i was looking up the calories of the fries we had been eating its an obsession nothing else matters when logging or looking up calories you turn into an horrible person yelling about going to restaurant b instead of a because their fish is 30 calories less not attending your grandmas birthday because the cake is homemade so you cannot calculate the calories of it and many more things i am sure most of us have went through i do not know why i wrote this i guess i wanted to celebrate and tell someone since neither my mum or doctors know i had been counting calories and also i thought this could make some people reflect on if they have been thought similar situations i know having an ed is being a slave overall but i cannot describe how much freedom i feel from stopping this behavior thanks for reading i wish everyone the best,1,426
what popular safe food drink do you just find absolutely disgusting i am going with diet coke coke zero and monster that shit is nasty sorry not sorry,1,28
i am glad i am european so i do not fucking know what x pounds are because i am used to kg i cannot trigger myself with some trigger warning numbers posts laughing out loud and i am too lazy to google it i literally have no concept of what x pounds are and i do not know how much 6 featuring is either i just know i am 5 2 but the rest no i am basically invincible because numbers cannot trigger me because i am jared 19 and i do not fucking know how to read,1,98
does anyone else get off to being told i am too skinny i want to start by saying this is not me being pro ed and i know its wrong but i wondered if anyone else gets like this for example whenever my mom says it i find i start smiling to myself i know its weird but i want to feel less alone,1,64
an unnecessary comment i got when being weighed the other day hey so this is my first time posting i have only just found this sub i have really not been feeling too good as of late about myself generally other issues related not ed related i have been stable for a year weight wise not behaviour wise but recently i had a very bad day and the day after was my monthly weigh in the scales are quite dodgy and gave a reading much below expected i said i know that is not right because everyone would be very concerned i was right the nurse kicked the scales about a bit moved the pointer back to zero and weighed herself to make sure they were okay i stepped back on and i have gained she turned to me and said bet you wish it was what it said before and laughed i have now been really struggling for the past couple of days and just feel terrible,1,168
i am still fucking sick even if you see me eat yes i am eating more i am weight restored but i am still sick my disordered thoughts are very much still there i engage in disordered behaviour please understand me i am still sick i still have an eating disorder it does not magically go away,1,57
i am going to be super honest right now more honest than i think i have really even been with myself up until now and i will probably never say this to an actual person but can anyone relate i love my ed i like people knowing i have one because maybe they will think oh damn she has lost weight or damn yeah she is skinny i also like telling people when i have not eaten all day because i am just so proud of myself for sticking to it call me an attention seeker cuz i know i guess i am but i get a rush when people notice this part of me but obviously i do not tell everyone i just get excited when they find out it is so fucked i know,1,136
i do not hate having an ed am i bad for thinking this i feel like having this mindset will stop me gaining weight and the constant anxiety is something i do not mind putting up with i want to loose more weight and not gain and always constantly obsessing over calories and exercise reassures me that i will not gain weight,1,62
to those of you attracted to the same sex how do your standards for your own body differ from what you are attracted to in other people i am a bi woman with a strong preference for women i do not think thinspo pictures have ever made me think wow she is gorgeous in an i would like to go out with her type of way i would 100 fuck my clone at a healthy borderline healthy weight but at my current weight i find myself genuinely unattractive it is not that i have some vague idea that i am too thin to conform to what most men find attractive i know what i find attractive i know full hips are hot that ribs are a turnoff that stick legs are unattractive etc my ed has never been about wanting to be attractive so that is not enough to stop me but it is a weird thing to think about i am too horny for healthy people to be able to delude myself into thinking i am doing anything other than making myself uglier,1,184
i have not purged in a few days someone be proud,1,11
i ate like a pig over the last couple days and i say this happily i spent christmas with my family i was underweight in the very middle of a relapse and there was a lot of delicious food and naturally i ate a lot of it and when i say a lot i do mean a lot not just somewhat beyond normal but an actual freaking lot at christmas eve and today at lunch i am lying on the sofa right now trying to cope with the food coma and the bloat and you know what it is okay i will be alright cannot be bothered to count the calories of what i ate and tally up just how much weight i will gain i know it is quite a lot i know that in the coming days i will regret this but right now it is okay i enjoyed christmas my belly is full and i am happy i slept well last night and i am no longer freezing cold anxious and nervous for a change it is late afternoon and i did not even notice because i did not spend my time staring obsessively at the clock waiting for my next meal to come i reconnected with my loved ones and had such a good time and that is what counts and believe me i do not want this post to come across as some kind of you can do this sanctimonious bullshit that is why i did not tag it as recovery win i am not in recovery i am very much still struggling i promise i know that in the next days the guilt will settle and the compulsion to restrict and starve and obsess will creep back in and i will be back into the ed spiral it is not over just because i managed to get some pause but right now i am okay i gained weight but i made the right choice i enjoyed moments i will treasure and remember fondly and i can only hope that you chose to do the same,1,351
does anyone else get jealous of how normal people eat and drink and stay slim when you are in you are early 20s and all you are friends go out and drink like 10 shots every weekend other friends instagram their massive calorific restaurant meals cocktails all over insta stories massive spreads of picnic food and grazing boards and you are out here with you are sad oatmeal at home alone thinking how the fuck you all eating that constantly and not gaining 3 meals a day and drinks and snacks how i am lost meanwhile i am out here with my xxx cal a day diet worrying that i am going to gain again as soon as i stop restricting or even if i have one day eating normally,1,130
oop i was updating my weight in the fitbit application and i accidentally forgot a number and typed something under 20lbs and fitbit congratulated me on a 100 pound weight loss and i cannot stop laughing,1,36
i just really do not know what to do anymore my husband is upset with me i do not think he finds me attractive anymore i have lost a lot of weight which was needed but now it is getting extreme i am back to the weight i was when we met 10 years ago but i was high restricting then and i am again now and i know he is unhappy about it i do not know what i thought but it was not that we would be fighting every night i forgot how cold you get i did not realize that at 30 your skin does not bounce back the same way so i am wrinkly and covered in loose skin i forgot how quickly you get drunk when you do not eat i do not make horrible decisions while drunk i would never drive or cheat or anything just make an ass of myself but the worst part is i literally cannot eat anymore eating makes me nauseous i forgot this part too i try i really really do but it absolutely sickens me i involuntarily threw up the other day from eating what would be considered a small meal by normal standards i am not underweight so treatment is hard to find and even if i did it is so expensive i am in the us our healthcare is garbage because i am not underweight my treatment would not be covered by insurance the cheapest i found was 2k a month i can go to a specialized therapist but they are also not covered and that would be 200 a session i am a stay at home mom we do not have that kind of money i am scared i will die i am trying i really am but i cannot stop no one understands everyone is upset and i am alone i just want to shrink and crawl in a hole and die so everyone will leave me alone finally if you made it this far thank you,1,343
does anyone else sometimes just pour salt into your hand and lick it up like a farm animal it helps my low blood pressure and dizziness sometimes i look at those pink himalayan salt lamps and think what if,1,39

dumbest things that have triggered your ed something that happened recently was my bf giving me a backrub and due to the position my arms were in my shoulder blades were less visible he then innocently asked where did your shoulder blades go cue instant panic thoughts like oh my god i have too much back fat i need to be more toned i want to look bony i moved and my shoulder blades became more visible but new goal unlocked am i right,1,84

does anyone else have to romanticize food in order to eat it like yes i am able to put actual sweetener in my coffee now but it has to be expensive ass local organic honey and i have to stir it into my vintage mug with a glass teaspoon and drink it in my silk pyjama set otherwise what is the point too long i did not read i will never be normal,1,73
for the love of fuck do not ever comment on someone is safe foods food makes me feel uncomfortable i can have a mental breakdown or panic attack because of food and i always end up purging while crying i am sure some of you know this feeling and that is why we have safe foods my ed is not logical at all my brain does not think healthy safe unhealthy danger some of my safe foods can be quite unhealthy it does not make sense but that is okay i have a very limited list of safe foods if i am eating a safe food something that does not make me feel uncomfortable i do not want to hear about how many calories it has or how unhealthy it is most of the time i am aware i am not trying to be a fitness expert i am just trying to survive lmao making someone feel bad about the things they eat can be dangerous to someone with sorry if i get the medical terms wrong an avoidant or restrictive type eating disorder because they might start overthinking it and eventually cutting out even more things from their diet kind of a dick move to be honest so please keep your nutritional info to yourself thank you 3 i am not saying that it has happened in this particular sub but i just wanted to vent,1,237

i have an absolutely gross question but want to know if anyone relates or if my body is just screwed you see all the time people with restrictive eating disorders talking about how they just cannot go to the washroom anymore even when they eat is it normal to be the opposite being restrictive constantly but instead of not being able to go whatever you eat goes right through to the point that it is not solid at all i have heard of gastroparesis and things making your stomach empty slower and as a result leading to constipation and stuff but what about the opposite is this maybe not an ed symptom but something different all together or has anyone else went through this sorry this is gross lmaooo i need answers and cannot find a thing on google,1,139
oh dear why did i ever start taking laxatives it is become such an ingrained behaviour that when i eat i have to take one and today i am in so much pain and feel so unwell i have been taking them every day for 9 days straight i had bloods done the other day and my doctor cannot access the results so i have no idea what it is doing to my body fucking eating disorders man,1,78
question for anyone who is willing to answer am i allowed to say i have a ed when i am not skinny i feel super invalid about it i just need some honest no bs answers,1,36
every time i see you you look thinner and prettier what is your secret i legit said haha thanks it is because i am not right upstairs while pointing my finger to my head and wiggling it in circles lmaoooooooo in front of my parents everyone laughed and she was all like well then i would be a supermodel then implying that she is also a bit crazy i know she was just trying to be nice amd she is actually a nice lady but i am just tired of being told i look better because of self destructive behaviour and misery i kind of feel bad about my comment now but what the fuck else should i have said what would you guys have said on the other hand f ck yeah i am objectively skinni,1,137
question for people that lost their periods did your period gradually get lighter each month and then stop because the past few months my periods have seemed to be getting lighter and lighter and my most recent one was the shortest and lightest period i have ever had and i have been restricting more lately,1,55
does anyone else keep getting ads for erectile dysfunction aka ed i have just seen my billionth erectile dysfunction ad on reddit and only now have just realised it is commonly referred to as ed is this why i am getting these ads because that would make sense why i am seeing them constantly i have literally 0 reason to see them as a female,1,65
solely blaming skinny models for the prevalence of eds is ignorant and dismisses my very real struggles i am tired of society blaming victoria s secret models for eds sure the model industry is full of unhealthy mentalities sexual exploitation and unhealthy eating behaviours but models did not influence my behaviour most models and celebrities look the way they look because they inherently have very active lifestyles and it is not as if they are hiding it someone who does acting for a living spends hours on set doing god knows what and maybe even a little bit of light yoga while eating whole foods is going to look quite different from a lot of us who have a sedentary low paying job and fall for the cheap easily accessible foods that surround us constantly what influenced my ed behaviours is living in a society that tries its damn hardest to make you obese but at the same time assigns less value to you if you are obese while at the same time promoting eating food as a legit hobby the last point is the one that drives me the most nuts from what society tells you any occasion any good and bad feelings any celebration even your free time has to be about food the majority of my friends have pictures of food on their timelines some more than others the majority of gifts i recieve and used to give are food sometimes me and others end up being dumped with food when a friend or family member accidentally cooks extra restaurants and social media are constantly trying to push the boundaries for the unhealthiest and cheapest food for the biggest portion sizes for the most frankenstein mish mash of unhealthy foods ever there are so many social media influencers who gloat and show how much food they eat many times to the extent of a mukbangs but are mysteriously slim and not everyone knows about the deception that goes on behind the scenes it is become a disturbing trend nowadays especially with teens to gloat about how much they eat and how lazy they are when their body and income really does not reflect that and i have heard how a lot of slim people fast or intentionally do not eat much during the day so that they can feast with friends and family but will almost never admit to it it is this juxtaposition in society a society that is obsessed with food but at the same time shuns the bad consequences of that a society that downplays individual effort and glorifies being born perfect         that has contributed to my ed behaviour i do not compare myself to obviously starving french runway models no i compare myself to the people i am surrounded by the people who are obsessed with food but are skinny the people who like to joke about how lazy they are but in reality do 5 extra curriculars the people who insist they are naturally like that without admitting all the hard work and dedication it took to become the person they are now and the thing is i find that a lot of recovered ed people and fat activists come full circle by accepting being overweight or obese as the norm because they think it takes too much effort within our current society to stay at a stable and healthy weight,1,569
i feel invalidated and embarrassed because of my lab results hey all i 21m just got lab results from my doctor who stated that my cholesterol is high not dangerously but still in the past even at my higher weights it has been fine so i am confused i know i need to talk to my doctor about this more and i will but for now i think ranting would be most helpful and i am not looking for specific advice but if anyone has similar experiences please let me know my dr suggested a low cholesterol diet which would be great except i do not and have not eaten anything that should raise it in a very long time and if anything i eat similar to that anyway just because of my restrictive ed sometimes i can go x days without eating and if i do eat in a day it is very little but it is always more healthy food i do not know i will say i am overweight i used to be considered obese and i have also been uw and in normal range as well so really all over the place haha but it is always been normal i guess i am just pretty triggered and disappointed in myself i am so embarrassed because i am doing all this restricting which does not seem to be doing much of anything it is kind of invalidating i guess i could go on more but i will not get into it right now anyway thanks for reading my rant,1,262
is it just me or has this subreddit become more pro ana y granted i do not check this sub as much as i used to everyday last year cat the peak of my ed but i have come back and there is definitely a bit of a shift i know that these sorta things can naturally come out because ed brain but i think we used to be more careful about what we say i do not know i might just be projecting because my ed has gotten a tinyyy bit better what do you all think,1,98
i hate how i look and then eat my feelings about it i wake up every morning and hate my body so so much and then i eat all day to make it bearable to make it through the day and then the cycle starts at again,1,47
if one more person in recovery posts underweight before pictures i am going to scream like that title says personally there is nothing more triggering than looking for some nice recovery content or even just browsing all and seeing underweight people eds are competitive in case anyone forgot,1,48
how do you deal with the end goal being death i am so sorry if this is a triggering topic for anyone please do not read it if it seems like it would be i am just so tired all i can think constantly is about death i just want to starve to death i keep trying to do things that i normally would have wanted to do i am applying to grad school i am trying to keep my job i watch my favorite youtubers etc but it just does not mean anything i just think about the calories in for the day and how empty i feel and how much food i have and when i might eat again and how weird and fraudulent i feel when i do eat i just want it all to be over because life does not mean anything anymore,1,147
anyone else disordered but everything revolves mainly around protein trigger warning obviously x200b used to be bulimic but the majority of my ed times have revolved around getting 80g or more of protein for under like 1000 calories x200b i used to workout like mad at the gym was really obsessed with not being skinny fat x200b never knew anyone else with an ed where they are obsessive over protein guessing its a form of orthorexia,1,76
tiktok girls who eat thousands of calories in recovery but are still super underweight as in these are ones who people actually think are genuine and get so many comments like oh my god you are so inspiring xxxx but they have been posting there 2500 calories recovery extreme hunger days for months but they have also remained super skinny for months       i actually do not get how people do not see through it its so damaging,1,77
i am either heavily restricting or binge eating and i hate that there is no in between for me it sucks my weight has fluctuated between 125 pound to 206 lb between the ages of 16 to now 27 i have lived a majority of my life being overweight i cannot stay at a healthy weight for too long i hate that i cannot maintain my weight i hate this obsession that i have with food i am so paranoid and worried about what both extremes are doing to my overall health i am either obsessively fixated on losing weight or i do not care at all when i am binging until after i have eaten and i start feeling guilty when i am binging i feel too guilty to check out any health weight loss related subreddits when i am restricting i am obsessed with them and cannot be productive i have been meaning to apply to jobs this whole week but i am so drained from exercising and restricting i have been watching my 600 pound life all day and browsing weight loss related subreddits i keep telling myself i will be productive at x time of the day or i will be productive tomorrow but it does not happen,1,212
developing an ed as an adult why why did this happen to me i am 23 developed an eating disorder at age 21 i never had issues with food as a kid teen i loved food soooo much now i just see food as fuel that is necessary to keep my body alive and wish i did not need it to survive sorry for the sadness i am just upset that i am about to hit the 2 year anniversary of the diet that ruined my fucking life,1,88
people with restrictive eds are not supposed to have community discussions of restrictive eating disorders online are so overly policed that most of us end up on anonymous forums where we cannot even really make a personalized profile and get to know people i used to have a really solid sense of community on tumblr and then i got banned overnight and i feel so alone and lost i was not even pro and stated it constantly i was even posting harm reduction tips rather than anything that would further someone is disorder just harm reduction practices for people who are not yet ready to recover like me everything is a fucking witch hunt when it comes to restrictive eds yet people with binge eating disorders who glamourize gaining deadly amounts of weight are celebrated the thing is eating disorders are eating disorders they are so similar except one makes you smaller and one makes you larger yet it feels like fat acceptance and pro binge eating apologists and even disgusting feederism fetishists are allowed total free reign of the internet to do and say whatever they like while we have to scurry around in corners and beg to be blocked instead of reported just to avoid being totally isolated in our illnesses even disgusting ana fetishists can sexualize and promote our illnesses with more freedom than we ourselves have to form a community and vent about it i literally feel like i have fewer freedoms than the vile men who fetishize my illness and would get off on my death i am so sick of it i feel so alone and it just makes me get sicker fuck the double standard all i had was that little haven of people going through the same thing and encouraging me to recover and it was taken away in an instant and i am too scared to contest it because they will just burn my entire account and my non ed related blog i have had since middle school will be gone too people really just want us to shut up and remain isolated because we belong in a padded room with our grippy socks and we are not supposed to be people with thoughts and friends who understand us,1,378
giant thighs i am upset you can see almost my entire ribcage and my hip bones are super prominent so my upper area is super gross and boney which is not what i am going for but my thighs are huge like larger than a normal person i am so bottom heavy and whenever i wear clothes and hoodies i look big because of them,1,65
i am going to say something incredibly fucked up to preface i know what is to come is disgusting i miss my anorexia let us be clear i do not miss the way i would dodge friend hangouts or getting dizzy when i stood up but i miss the control i felt over my own body since recovery i have not been able to recognize myself in the mirror and i actively avoid reflective surfaces maybe that is a sign i am not mentally recovered i do not know but something is very wrong with me for thinking this way i think did any of you all do any of you relate and how do i combat this please help it feels like i am drowning in my own body and brain,1,132
i do not want to enter recovery because i am scared it will last too little i am currently underweight and i see recovery as that magical time where i will be able to eat whatever i want because you know i have weight to gain anyway and when i say whatever i want i do not mean the b llshit weight gain 2 500kcal meal plan with balanced meals thing i actually mean whatever i want which is wayyyyy more than that but then i am scared it will last too little and that at some point i will have to restrict again because i will have to reduce my calories in order to maintain at that point i would rather just stay underweight and keep the illusion and maybe binge every once in a while so that at least i can enjoy that food as well,1,148
does anyone else have the feeling that they can solve everything by losing more weight i am 25 underweight had anorexia nervosa as a teen and i have never been the same since i have fluctuated in weight but i have been underweight or severely underweight for the past 3 years being significantly underweight makes me happy underweight only is not enough it makes me feel iike myself it makes me feel loveable as in by my friends my colleagues my family makes me feel as if i were a child deserving of care and not being alone in the world makes me feel like my grandparents who have always been very weight focussed would think better of me and my mum too makes me feel fragile so maybe people will be more careful and not try to hurt me makes me feel like if everything else is crumbling and scaring me and uncertain and wobbly and i do not know what is going to happen at least i am skinny and getting skinnier my bones more prominent my pants more loose people making more jokes about how i am lifting my own body weight when i go to lift a cat disappearing how can they hate me if i barely exist and if like has happened so many times before i descend into nothing my self worth no longer exists i feel like a floating unimportant sinful human that should not even be here at least there is one good thing about me and that is being boney thin and getting thinner,1,263
why does my eating disorder have to be the very first thing i think about when i wake up literally why it is like it is my whole personality or something everything seems to connect to it in some way,1,40
may i have some reassurance on bananas please i want to buy some bananas but my mind is not fully okay with that for whatever reason honestly do not even know why i am scared of them probably just so many people being against them stuck with me like in terms of calories i am okay with it like its similar to a bar which is safe for me my brain is just no banana i just want a banana so some reassurance would help are they a safe food for any of you guys ty edit thank you so much everyone it helped i bought the bananas and will be eating them,1,113
anyone else actually mad that most superskinnies on ssvsss do not even try like jeez if you are not even going to consider the possibility of consuming more than half a slice of toast with jam and some red bull then why go to the show in the first place it feels like they are intending to humble brag about their stomach capacity being soo tiny,1,66
does anyone else developed an obsession with eating only oatmeal for breakfast from their ed i used to only eat oatmeal for breakfast when i was deep in my ed i would throw a fit when i see somebody else from my family getting oatmeal from the container although it was supposed to be for everyone t was a wild time to say the least,1,65
seeing people gain weight but still enjoy life makes me feel secure like seeing a person go from fairly fit to chubby or downright large but they still behave the same way as they used to and no one in i e the social media comments mentions the weight gain that makes me feel so good because like it let us me know there is no rush i am still me i can take my time like it calms me when i am in a binge episode or something because it just shows me it is just life and stuff but then i remember i am a zoomer,1,108
do you ever calculate you are maintenance calories and you are just like i do not believe you because i eat way under what it says and i am not rapidly dropping weight or anything it is like a very very slow decline so how is it even possible double what i am currently eating is maintenance like i do not believe you what does an online calculator know about my body and calories in the first place sorry for the ed paranoia dump,1,84
is anyone else actually glad they have a small chest i am not sure but this might be triggering to ladies with larger busts so please read with caution i think i would actually be very depressed and extremely uncomfortable in my own body if i had large or even average sized boobs i already am very uncomfortable so i do not think i could handle it people especially men always oversexualize boobs it would be something sitting right on my chest and i could not even hide them if they were large so i would constantly be sexualized i am still sexualized in other ways and all boobs are sexualized to an extent but i mean you cannot deny the gross way big boobs are talked about by men also i feel like i would look unproportional and not as skinny i do not know i feel sad that i think like this because i should not be grateful to have a small chest due to oversexualization i should not feel like if i had a large chest it would push me over the edge,1,186
how do you all eat out when you cannot count calories this is making me so sick because i am so anxious about going out and eating normally its eating me up and i want to die please help me i can only eat if i know calories i am struggling,1,51
is it just me or is this sub becoming toxic,1,10
laugh my ass off say what you want ab this disorder but my girlfriend likes to make herself cum on my hip bones so i am thriving,1,27
does anyone else not log their food anymore but still look at it and try to keep track in their head i stopped logging my calories because i wanted to get better i try to keep a count of my daily cals in my head and its so bad,1,49
has your ed ever gotten in the way of your career or long term plans because it sure as fuck did for me x200b a few years ago i planned on becoming a doctor so i went to an open house for one of the med schools i wanted to apply to a bunch of students and faculty gave talks about what life at med school was like which i was super interested in but then after the first round of talks they announced they would be serving lunch for everyone in the cafeteria and it was at that moment i thought ah no my eating disorder is more important than going to med school so i just left and did not attend the second round of talks held after lunch x200b so yeah i am about to graduate college soon and i have zero career plans because i prioritized my ed over my hopes and dreams,1,157
what is you are most embarrassing ridiculous trigger anime characters for me specifically female characters their bodies are always so ideal and inhumane and the way they are depicted to eating so much food which is supposed to make them even more desirable anyway what about you all,1,48
why do people post weight loss b as on tiktok and then when people ask how they did it say oh it was super unhealthy do not copy me they damn well know when they post a weight loss transformation people are going to ask how is it for attention if it is so unhealthy and bad why are they posting it to tiktok with a cute song and or dance and smiling this one video of this girl duetting herself dancing to beez in the trap showed up on my fyp and she is clearly lost a decent amount of weight between the photos the caption is basically same outfit different girl the comments are all asking her how she lost it and she made a pinned comment talking about how she lost it during covid and it was not healthy at all then why post it if unhealthy weight loss is so bad why are you glorifying it with a quirky nicki song people really do be speaking out of both sides of their mouths,1,177
my perception of what skinny looks like has changed so much over the years for example 3 years ago before i even had disordered eating habits i used to think that monica geller from friends looks extremely scrawny now when i watch the episodes she looks just normal body weight to me if it was not the same episodes i would think that she gained weight does anyone else think like this,1,72
are looks all that matter deep down i believe it i have always believed that looks are truly the only thing that matter and that people who say they like confidence and stuff are just superficial assholes who are either trying not to seem superficial or who lack the self awareness to even know how superficial they are is this true am i right or is this another disordered ass lie i am telling myself i think the latter but god every experience in my life has shown me otherwise,1,90
stomach lump opinions after i purged the other night i was looking at my stomach and noticed above me bellow button right in the centre of my stomach is a slight bulge could it be a hernia has anyone experienced this,1,41
rapid weight loss is like a fucking drug to me that is it that is the post figured it would be relatable,1,22
unpopular opinion maybe honestly i think they should just scrap the diagnoses like anorexia bulimia bed and so on and have it as more of an open spectrum diagnosis almost everyone i know with an ed has symptoms of multiple eds and since the diagnoses are so strict sticking someone in a box like that is almost never a completely accurate representation of their struggles i do not know if i am making any sense but oh well edit yeah looking back i definitely worded this badly lol but it is been super interesting to see people s different perspectives on this,1,102
gahghhh wish i could lose weight without anyone noticing i just want it to be a secret,1,17
tiny wins was taking a look at my old mfp logs last night and came to the realization that i have gone from using 8 calories of almond milk in my coffee to now currently using 35 40 calories of creamer sometimes i feel like i am going backwards or not making any progress at all but this is giving me hope because it really can only go up from here hopefully,1,72
recovery content baby talk i am so tired of recovery content treating us like morons and babies i cannot stand the whole i know da cookie is scawy but let us take a bite together otay i feel like it just reinforces the idea that eds only affect young girls when we all know that is not true i am a woman in my 20s but i cannot even imagine trying to find recovery content as a middle aged man or something i am sure it is isolating tabitha farrar is pretty much the only one who does not treat us like idiots,1,103
it is my birthday and i am eating a poke bowl without tracking and i am happy about it here is a sign to try be gentle with yourself today if you can was a kind of shitty day stayed home alone all day and was counting cals restricting but i have been craving a poke bowl for ages so i got one for dinner a touch of guilt but i feel mostly okay and i am glad i got it hope everyone is doing okay today love you try give yourself some compassion today,1,95
unpopular opinion i hate the whole in recovery persona sometimes it seems to me that being in recovery becomes this whole new identity for people with eds like you are no longer on the verge of death you are maybe eating three meals a day and maintaining a somewhat acceptable weight and you post cute pics of your food on instagram together with motivational quotes so you are in recovery i hate this it makes recovery look like this very fuzzy state of your personality where you do not have a very severe ed but also are not really going anywhere being in recovery means you are getting to a recovered state and you are actually supposed to be recovered some day it should not mean running around in circles always doing the same things over and over again you are not supposed to spend your whole life in recovery i mean what is even the line between having an ed and being in recovery then i can be deep into my worst relapse ever but if like one day i eat somewhat normally or i challenge one single thought or i talk about recovery then i am in recovery to me being in recovery means i am working towards being recovered it does not just mean that i am no longer in my honeymoon phase and am aware of my ed yet still have one and i know that recovery looks differently to everyone so i really do not want to gatekeep people but still it really rubs me the wrong way how being in recovery seemingly becomes this lifelong persona and you maybe had an ed like one semester in middle school and you are now in your 30s and in recovery since then   even though you have always had disordered behaviours in the meantime and never really reached a fully healthy state i even feel that the in recovery thing is used as an excuse to still get away with ed behaviours but hey i am in recovery now so it is not that bad right i actively engage in an ed becomes oh i am struggling because i am in recovery it just starts to sound like yet another very subtle excuse i hate to call people out but just to give you an example   i once came across this girl called recovery chii or something on youtube instagram she is very clearly ill but somehow she is in recovery because on the other hand someone like megsy recovery actually showed a process recovery for me is transition i do not want to settle down for in recovery it makes no sense to me,1,448
i hope this is not controversial but please stop gendering a non gendered disease we are all going through it and exclusivity and gatekeeping for a f cking disease is dangerous as f ck sincerely a man who is been dealing with ana since he was 10 years old and recently relapsed due to some ignorant comments on a f cking support page,1,63
as a former sufferer of bed what i consider a binge is not what others consider a binge maybe this does not apply to everyone but i just wanted to make a post talking about my experience with this i used to binge badly like real binge eating disorder then i recovered from bed but have not yet recovered from the restricting side i still restrict and i still over eat on occasion but i can truly say i do not binge anymore and have not for about a year and a half now my point is that because i used to binge i know how bad binging can get i know what a real binge is i am talking 5000 calories in a couple hours and easily over 10k calories within a day maybe this seems crazy but it is really really easy to eat thousands of calories in a couple hours if you truly binge now that i do not binge anymore i am aware that eating a bit more of x or a double portion of y over christmas is not the end of the world i ate 800 calories of chocolate on christmas and i went over my daily limit by like 600 first it made me uncomfortable then i remembered 2 years ago how i would have consumed thousands of calories simply because i went over my limit and i eased up and felt proud of myself for not only overcoming binging but being able to distinguish the difference between the two the reason i am telling you this is that in the past i would have absolutely considered this a binge but after truly suffering with bed i know it is not i have seen a few posts of people on this sub saying things like oh no i binged on 1 peice of pizza and a block chocolate and i know how awful this feels but in reality that is not a binge it just feels like it to people with restrictive eds as a former binge eater please do not torture yourself about going slightly over your calories by the end of the month that slip will make little to no difference what will make a difference is days and days of eating over 8k calories due to binging this is just my person experience but i think binging calories are in the thousands up to 10 000 and over eating calories are in the hundreds up to 900 just wanted to talk about this to maybe get people with eds to relax and realize that what feels like binging to us actually is not its okay we will be okay,1,449
having an ed as an asian girl is so hard having an ed is hard in general so i do not want to downplay anyone s experience but while i am relatively thin in america whenever i visit my family in vietnam or thailand i am huge and everyone comments on it i get so many comments from literal strangers who tell me or my mom or family that i am curvy and look so much more grown up than i am this guy once who was like 25 asked me on a date when i was 14 and when i told him my age he said he never saw those hips on someone that young my hip size is literally 33 and i do not have a good waist to hip ratio at all which is something i actually really want so i was literally like wtf when i talk about my eating struggles to a few people they will always be surprised and say that asian girls are naturally skinny anyways and some even said if i had an ed they would expect me to be skinnier plus with my family all my cousins are super thin and petite while i am just slightly heavier from my shoulders to waist to thighs but never anything that is good like hips and boobs,1,224
anyone else feel gross kissing someone after they just ate and tasting what they ate even if it is something i actually like the taste of it just gives me an icky feeling,1,33
is there anybody else who just does not want to recover it might sound dumb but i know what recovery means i want to recover from the thoughts and be content with myself but i do not want to do so in a way that i am going to gain weight and hate myself again i truly do not think weight loss is bad for me i binge a lot and get pretty big i think i am healthier when i have lost weight is it stupid to not want to recover am i the only person who thinks this,1,100
i miss my underweight self i do not want this to sound like i am pro ana i am not at all and i do not even care if this gets deleted i just want it off my chest the thing is to most people that know me they would assume that i do not struggle with eating anymore since i put on some weight and i am now at a healthy weight i look healthy so i should be fine right but i am just not and i am tired of it i miss when my family wanted me to eat more i miss when they used to check up on me and make sure i ate i miss when everyone did that i miss when eating felt justified somehow i miss how my body used to feel like i miss the toxic community i had now i really do not have anywhere to go i do not have anyone checking up on me i mean why would they i look fine i hate the shame i feel whenever i eat i hate the isolation and loneliness i feel i hate the overthinking and i hate the fact that no one would ever understand it i kind of hate recovery,1,211
for fellow pixar fans what would an ed look like in inside out would it just be another island or maybe little people taking over the mind or something i do not know i am actually curious to here your thoughts,1,41

my eating disorder makes me feel like an animal i cannot really put it into words exactly just something about having an eating disorder makes me feel genuinely like a fucking animal like my whole family eats except for me i eat gross shit that nobody wants sometimes i even dig in the trash to get food during a bad binge i eat alone huddled in a corner so nobody sees i pick apart all my food dissecting it trying to make it seem edible i just feel like an actual animal i do not feel like a human being anymore it is so fucking degrading,1,106

way i just realized this bs fucked me up part 457 having an ed and having eaten disordered for the past who knows how long i just realized i have no fucking clue what amount of food is ever appropriate did i just binge or was that a snack and i just am restricting too hard like i genuinely have no clue and if i am still kind of munchy if i go get something else is that a binge or honouring my body s signals i am fucking lost here you all,1,93

having an eating disorder is exhausting that is all it is just so tiring waking up every morning and stepping on the scale it is tiring when i see a bulge in my stomach it is tiring trying to count calories at random restaurants it is tiring forcing myself to work out it is tiring doing random wrist checks all day it is tiring trying to work out my jaw line i am exhausted all the time i am stressed out with fasting all the time and not hitting my goal i get sad when i gain weight eating things that make me happy in the moment i cannot even enjoy cake on my birthday,1,115
advent calendar calories do not count thank you for coming to my ted talk,1,14
i saw a tiktok about a woman who lost her sense of taste from covid and i was jealous she was talking about how eating food was a nightmare because everything tasted disgusting she is rapidly lost a lot of weight and cannot stomach more than a few protein shakes each day she was crying about how much this affected her life and i felt so shitty but all i could think was how i wish i could hate the taste of food so i could lose weight that quickly she is going through something traumatic and horrible and here i am wishing it could be me and that just made me feel like such a terrible person,1,118
eating food out of the trash makes me feel like a little raccoon,1,13
overeaten over christmas i have eaten so much the past few days probs 5000 calories per day but for the first time in a while i have not counted calories or restricted myself at all i focused on enjoying delicious food with my family and loved it ate so much chocolate and did not feel too bad ab it sort of reminded me of a time before this silly disorder took over my brain now am sitting very bloated but it is ok for now am hoping that guilt will not come but have a feeling it is inevitable and ed voice spiral will commence especially if i have gained weight anyway going to bask in this weirdly guilt free bubble for now hope everyone is having a lovely christmas i know this is an especially hard time for many 3,1,141
i ate a normal meal i think i got a book called 8 keys to recovering from an eating disorder on impulse and the parts i read so far were pretty good i was on the verge of binging after restricting really bad and hitting a new lw this week but then i remembered the chapter i read about your eating disorder self vs your heathy self about how your ed thoughts can be counteracted with healthy self thoughts i recognized the voice telling me to order pizza and the one telling me to fast were both my eating disorder self so i did the opposite and ordered a tim hortons sandwich donut and calorific drink is this a normal amount of food for a meal i hope and did not look up the calories and ate it i feel so i do not know empowered guilty both this is the first time i have ignored my eating disorder voice in like ten years i feel weird being a normal amount of full instead of starving or stuffed i do not know what to think i think i am proud of myself,1,192

how do you all feel about exercise i think that many people avoid exercise in the ed community and focus more on the food part of it but are there people that do exercise not really as a purging method but daily i used to purge via exercise before and when i try to do a normal amount now it is a battle to manage my thoughts has anyone gone through this i quit doing it very consistently but i want to do exercise now in a better way that makes me satisfied without feeling like i will faint i feel like i am slowly going back into that control cycle how should i know when i am doing more if it never feels like enough except for when my abs are burning,1,133
ladies i ate a full days food and nothing bad happened i shook to my core i ate three meals and was convinced i was going to gain 10 pounds i did not i pooped and i am the same weight again i just had this moment in my bathroom then i was like oh yeah i am out of touch with reality i seriously think eating a meal will make me gain a whole five pounds or more that one day of eating can ruin everything and that i should feel very guilty that is simply not true i just forget that i am a mammal yes know a warm blooded creature who needs certain things to grow and exist not just something to look at that i am not a lump of clay just to mold with what i eat something that can be mashed or rolled at any time i am not something that if it gets swollen it needs to be replaced like a battery i am not a structural coulomb that is bending because of weight i am not an over fed goldfish who is going to die i am just a dude like any other dude what the actual frick i love science why cannot i apply science to myself yes everyone else should eat according to the food pyramid except me am i a vase i am using as an ash tray no holy heck i think i am finally back on the recovery train shout out to my chef boyfriend k thanks bye love you one food confused hoe to another edit sorry i said ladies in the title this is for everyone i just say ladies a lot in my every day life and i did not even think about it in an internet context when i say ladies you are included and i love you,1,315

psa do not do laxatives kids this is a very real story that happened just a moment ago 24 hours ago i drank a laxative tea that i have had many times before it normally works within 12 hours sometimes it does not work at all i thought this was one of those times went to my boyfriend s house ate chilled and suddenly oh god thankfully he is gaming so i snuck downstairs to use the washroom the explosion began i have anxiety when it comes to using someone else s washroom because i am afraid they will hear something even just peeing gives me anxiety so you can imagine how i was feeling it probably only lasted 3 minutes but it felt like an eternity it was time to wipe but oh no the toilet paper was running low i prayed to a god i do not believe in that the toilet paper would be enough it just barely was good thing i planned on showering tonight anyway but now i am afraid i do not think it is over yet that familiar cramping and gurgling in my belly will not stop i found toilet paper and put it in the washroom so i got that going for me i pray that if it hits again it will be while he is gaming still but he knows i do not use the washroom much he will know something is up cue bathroom anxiety let it be known laxatives truly do no good not only do they fuck up your system but you may be faced with an embarrassing situation pray for me update it happened again why am i sharing this because you all got to know how horrible laxatives are i showered after the second time now i am sitting here sore in places i would rather not be sore and wondering when it will happen again the next time he will be in the room right by the washroom praying my body let us me live since i am all showered now i am thinking i should wear a pad to bed just incase this is my idea of hell oh and i ate spicy korean food today so it has not been a pleasure coming back out,1,382
what to eat when greatly increasing calories i am truly committed to recovery i need to gain a ton of weight and am at an honesty life threatening bmi right now i have tried a few tactics to increase my intake like drinking protein shakes between meals etc but that just makes me feel nauseous some increase ideas are obvious to me like replacing my normal everyday lunch sandwich of a tiny amount of pb2 on a tiny piece of low cal bread with regular bread and pb but stuff like that is not enough of an increase any ideas what worked for you i know some people who go all in or just in general super increase their intake eat a bunch of cookies and donuts and burgers but i know that having tons of added sugar and junk food just make me feel awful both physically and emotionally and i do not think that is a plan that would work for me so i would love to hear what worked for others either in terms of a general tactic eg eating x number of granola bars every day or specific foods,1,193
actual conversation i had with my psychiatrist over zoom just now paraphrased her so how is your appetite been have your eating habits been okay me well i have been eating a lot more lately and i am kind of worried her oh okay do you have a scale at home me thinking she is about to ask me to not look at it throw it out uhhh yeah her do you think you could weigh yourself for me right now me uh okay her how much do you weigh me 1xx high number pounds her incredulous oh wow are you sure about that that is a lot me uhh yeah her okay anyways i am not worried about putting you on the wellbutrin then if you are eating a lot like goddamn even my psychiatrist thinks i am fucking fat welp if i did not want to relapse before,1,150

my goofy coworker made me feel like a superhero several years ago i worked at a grocery store we got a new guy my age who worked my shift on the same days and we became fast friends after a couple months of talking around this time of year i opened up to him about my binge restrict cycles that because me to lose gain a lot of weight in short periods of time his response was omg so you are like a shape shifter i laughed so hard and i never forgot he moved back to his home state in the spring and he is very anti social media so i have not heard from him if there is any chance you are here reed you were a fuckin riot and i miss you thanks for making me feel better,1,141

does anyone else feel like eating healthy and ed is the same thing sometimes like i genuinely try to eat healthy and the way i am supposed to but for my height and weight my tdee is so low that i can basically only eat one meal a day sometimes i feel like if i am eating more than i am just not being healthy i do not even know if i have just convinced myself that omad is ed behavior to make myself feel better for eating too much or if i am genuinely not supposed to eat much at all for my health,1,105
why is my first reaction to every minor inconvenience hmm maybe i should stop eating i am tired of myself but even this exhaustion that i feel from having to constantly fight against my urge to stop eating makes me think that maybe i would feel better if i stopped eating how do i abandon these cyclical thoughts i wish i could turn off my mind and now i am thinking hey you know what you could do that would numb you out and silence your thoughts there is nothing new to this i have done it all before why cannot my brain give up and move on already i have wasted my entire adolescence and early adulthood on this bullshit how much longer will it take for me to move on am i really going to be a lifer am i just going to keep wasting all of my relationships and opportunities on this how much longer can my body take this before i start getting those really fucked up long term consequences besides the less fucked up long term consequences i already have of course fuck anorexia ugh i am tired and angry now smad,1,197

are rice cakes as good as everyone says they are came across them at my local supermarket but did not buy them as i was not sure if i would even like them or not i usually decide whether something is safe or not by the x calories per 100g thing not by 1 serving and i checked they were pretty mid high in calories it is just that 1 piece of them is low in calories do they even have a taste are they sweet savory tasteless are they basically like low calorie bread by texture are they soft or hard do you personally like them or consider them a safe food sorry for all the dumb questions laugh my ass off,1,123
i feel like i should not even be on this sub because i am failing at my ed i hate this so much like i know that is still very disordered to think but i literally have lost my ability to restrict i just keep eating and binging with the occasional purge and i am miserable feeling like i cannot even have an eating disorder correctly hurts so fucking much,1,70
is a 5 day vacation long enough to put on a significant amount of weight went on a 5 day long vacation and ate a ton of food like 3 restaurant meals a day plus drinks and snacks i am so bloated and panicking that i have gained 10 lbs when i look in the mirror i can see it i am embarrassed to go home and see my family because i feel like they are all going to notice usually i am so strict and weigh out everything i eat but i really let loose and enjoyed myself on this trip i had such a good time but now i am beginning to obsess about the potential weight gain edit thank you all for the kind words and reassurance i feel better now trying not to be too hard on myself,1,142

i saw my ribs through my chest for the first time today i did not know it was that bad like i struggle everyday mentally but i started at 185 so in the beginning i had weight to work with now i am around 112 and 8 pounds away from being underweight for my height it does not feel real i feel huge still i have been telling my therapist and social worker that i need treatment before it gets even worse but they do not take it seriously and that just makes me feel even more invalidated with my anorexia it makes me feel like i am too fat to have an eating disorder and i need to keep pushing myself and that is so fucking sick i am absolutely disgusting i have not thought about self harm in a long time but everything s starting to get too much again,1,152
reading up on the health risks of chewing spitting and there is something that does not make sense to me all these websites say that when you chew food it sends signals to your stomach telling it to ramp up stomach acid in preparation of digestion they say that if you do not actually swallow the food then it can eventually lead to problems like stomach ulcers and the like if this behaviour is repeated often however there is one very common instance of people chewing without swallowing gum i literally had some in my mouth while i was reading these websites and i am just confused how is chewing spitting dangerous in this way but chewing gum is completely fine i do both very frequently so i am either very at risk of stomach ulcers or these websites are making a mountain out of a molehill laugh my ass off,1,151
guys i am 2 months binge free today started slowly increasing my cals and tracking macros a little over 2 months ago and i went from binging weekly to just not at all which surprised me because i was under the impression all my binges were emotion based like i am currently still in a deficit so this whole thing is a mystery to me anyways cheers,1,67
does anyone else have a midnight to midnight food rule the title s a bit confusing but i guess i have a food rule where i count my days as midnight to midnight like if i am having trouble sleeping as i normally do but eat something even just a few minutes after midnight i count it as part of that day so that when i wake up i already pretty much have the doomer i already ruined today thoughts and just eat whatever i want i feel like this is weird but i am just wondering if it is more common than i thought,1,105

went to look for old photos of myself to body check instead found photos of my grandmother when she was alive and healthy and now i am sobbing in bed because i regret wasting time being bulimic while she was still alive instead of just being with her seeing old photos of her made me realize just how much weight she lost when she got sick she was sick for so long i forgot what she looked like before seeing her unable to eat made me feel guilty for enjoying food that she could not and i would eat and feel guilty and purge i know she would hate to see me like this but i cannot stop i just hope she never found out what i was doing and that wherever she is now she still does not know but in the hospital she told me that she would watch over me after she died i feel so awful at the possibility of causing her even more suffering when she is supposed to be at peace i miss her cooking i miss her encouraging me to eat it is so unfair that good people have to suffer so much before they die i feel like i fucked things up too much and cannot find a way out i do not know how i can recover from this i did something unforgivable by putting my addiction before my family and i do not know how to fix it,1,248
i genuinely feel like i get more compliments when actively restricting even if i have not lost any weight it is bizarre are there subconscious cues they are picking up on is it just my ed brain convincing me starvation is better both neither anything else i do not know,1,50

influencers on ig who are ed recovery advocates extremely triggered by an account that showed up in my explore feed she is clearly anorexic rail thin emaciated she posts plant based recipes and photos of her in her lingerie in her profile is says ed recovery in one of her posts she states that she is selling a bundle of recipes and workouts and so on originally priced at over 4 100 sale price is 50 what in the flying fuck she is also not a registered dietitian or fitness health coach why do these girls think they are qualified to do this it is so harmful every ed support group i attend someone always mentions social media and the toxicity of this very same situation how is posting photos of your rail thin body in lingerie helping the ed recovery community it is pure narcissism,1,146
coworker s unnecessary comment i work at a cafe that carries coffee cake and every shift i work i decide to have one it is a nice comfort food for me and i really feel like i deserve it for the work i do my coworker seems to disagree as i was warming it she looked at it and then me and said you really eat that everyday and i told her yeah it is so good you should try one and she said yeah it is good but i could only have those once a month the sugar content and calories are too much for me i do not get how you eat that everyday my other coworker stepped in and said did not you just eat a sugar cookie in the back and she was silent but i was already really hurt i have gained weight because i am not suffering from bulimic tendencies anymore i know a coffee cake is not someone is usual comfort food but it makes me feel good when i eat it and does not bother me until now i feel so insecure because all of my coworkers are very thin i have not felt triggered in such a long time buti feel this sinking pit in my stomach because of this,1,219
i hate how intermittent fasting is seen as a healthy and normal way to lose weight yeah just starve yourself for x hours and then reward yourself with food like that is not a getaway to disordered eating behavior if you are not able to lose weight the usual way and have to resort to if maybe consider that there is something wrong with your eating patterns and thoughts around food instead of acting like if is some hack to lose weight,1,82
i hate what i look like but i have no idea what i look like,1,15
damn the green leafs i like smoking weed it makes me comfy and chill what i do not like is that i get the fattest cravings and start b p last time i ate cake i baked for me and my bf he was kind of pissed that i ate most of the cake it happens so often when i am high that i just eat everything until i am ready to purge why cannot i just be high and starve i hate it,1,84

does eating food that is not as good as expected trigger a binge for anyone else i made a relatively low calorie but still pretty good salad and the spinach i put in it had gone bad it did not ruin the whole salad but some bites i could definitely taste it and it was not fun for some reason that just makes me want to binge sm more its so frustrating because i need my food to be the perfect balance between good and not too good so its still worth it but its not so good that i end up binging purging it and that balance is so hard to find sometimes i managed not to b p yesterday but i feel like i am still stuck in a b p phase of my ed because my urges are insanely strong,1,143

does anyone else do not count calories do not have fear food i tried counting calories never lasted more than 2 days i do not have fear food but i do have food that i will limit the intake a lil about myself if i snack throughout the whole day or have 1 proper meal this is considered overeating for me if i eat some snacks within 8pm 9pm this is usually ok for me i will not feel guilty or what not but if i ate a meal it is not ok for me i will feel depressed and useless also if i plan not to eat any solids food that day i do not mind drinking calorie rich unhealthy drinks like bubble tea frappe milkshake etc completely unrelated i treated myself some sushi takeaway earlier i feel so happy because it is my first normal meal this month and surprisingly i did not feel guilty i hope my weighing scale will not make me sad tomorrow morning though,1,170
just passed out trying to take a shower well hello negative consequences to my actions i almost forgot about you,1,20
how my mom found out i was faking recovery long hey i this is my first post i am sharing something that happened to me when i had finished treatment for anorexia a long time ago i guess you could consider this a cautionary tale a short time after this went down i sort of woke up as i realised the extent of what happened and what didn t happen i am recovered today and this event and my mindset scares the shit out of me trigger warning calories lbs substance abuse overdose health related issues i always considered myself to have had an ed from the age of 13 16 but the problems started when i was 10 with dieting and body checking i was not successful until i turned 13 i have never in my life sat on a seesaw to have fun and i still remember the nutritional label of my favorite snack 15 years later 30g of fat 436 calories i stole my dads step counter when i should have stolen his money or candy at the grocery store i recently found a shady illiterate diary entry from elementary school where i wrote down my competitors weight with an omg and exclamation points with competitors i am referring to the other girls that were early bloomers like me one day i managed to quit eating and my weight went down fast it was my first time accomplishing something i put my mind to it got progressively worse over a span of 6 months but i was somehow never admitted anywhere a mild case of re feeding syndrome and 2 3 of my hair in the drain from one shower later i agreed to start therapy i half assed it to calm my parents so they would leave me alone and i could gain windows of opportunity it worked but along the way i noticed that i desperately did not want those windows because i was hungry and i was at peace if i had no options i finished therapy a year later when i was considered satisfactory due to the scale displaying the number they choose 4 of those pounds were water but it could have been worse the same summer i completed recovery i was hospitalized after oding on some pills i had overindulged and eaten one taco more than i had allowed myself i was too exhausted to purge or walk 500 calories so i decided to take some pills that had tachycardia as a side effect so it would be like jogging without jogging an hour and a mouthful later i got the notion that i had made a big mistake i cried hysterically and re read the pamphlet with side effects multiple times paranoia was a common one which is ironic i caved told my mom and we were picked up by an ambulance shortly after i lied and said i had mistakenly taken medicine instead of a dietary supplement my heart rate was 160 bmp blood pressure 190 110 and i had a fever of 104 eyes black from pupil dilation laying on the stretcher full of regret embarrassment and shame i contemplated whether or not i should have said anything the doctors at the pediatric ward seemed very perplexed because it was not a common drug to od on it was an extended release formula with doses being dropped at different intervalls they gave me 0 8 l of medicinal charcoal which is more or less like thick wet sand at this point my chest felt like it was defying gravity and a force was pulling me towards the ceiling no one knew when the second dose would be released and time was of the essence they handed me the only chaser they had and told me to drink coca cola 40 calories pr 100 ml a total of 500 ml drinking it would have made my taco indulgence surplus situation worse so i declined i was informed about the extended release threat but 200 calories somehow seemed worse i managed to swallow it all without any liquid and the doctors gave each other a look to my surprise we had to stay the night if you know anything about hospitals if a nurse checks your vitals every 10 min throughout an entire night you might be high risk when i turned down the coke my mom knew the reason she suddenly understood the extent of the disorder and how far i was willing to go i had taken maybe x15 the appropriate dose this medicine is no longer available otc and if you have any risk factors for common diseases you cannot get a prescription either the reason being a growing number reports of brain hemorrhages at therapeutic dosages the headaches i had the following days were excruciating like heart palpitations at the roof of the mouth i hurt my mom occupied a hospital bed and could perhaps have been minutes away from permanent brain damage or death all i was concerned about was the 40 pr100 ml and wheat tortilla my mom was allowed to stay with me and got an extra bed we stayed in a one patient room right across the watch room and there was a painting of winnie the pooh on the wall in between nurse checkups we played a sick game of which food item will appear as the charcoal came back up my mom messed with me so i would not understand the severity of the situation and possible complications trying to prevent my vitals from spiking the image of the winnie the pooh painting stuck with me as it felt like a different lifetime and represented what i missed out on while being preoccupied we were discharged the following morning after having repeated the supplement mistake bit they were not convinced and told me to be extra cautious as they don t know if i would have woken up if i did not catch the mistake when i came home the first thing i did was run to the bathroom and step on the scale i had to hide a smile the rest of the day as i had lost 4 pounds in one night the first thing my mom did was compare the medication and the supplement without telling me they looked nothing alike and i had taken 3 supplements in total from the box she became very quiet for a while after sort of distant i then decided to finally tell the truth if your main takeaway from this is searching for the pill after reading 4 pounds in 1 night please seek help if you have not already if you think this seems a bit extreme remember that i was considered low risk too healthy for admission and recovered lapse of judgement is at the core of eating disorders think twice before taking shortcuts and give recovery a chance to help you if you are dishonest the worst outcome is them buying it there are no words for what i put my mother through and what she must have been thinking while joking at my bedside i could have either died or been in a vegetative state right now for the sake of restricting calories leaving my parents asking why there was no note,1,1226
i am at the highest weight i have ever been and i cannot handle it anymore i hate how i look now every minute of every day i am worrying about people seeing my double chin it is disgusting honestly it does not even make any sense my body is skinny and athletic but my face makes me look obese i just want to k ll myself honestly i have tried everything to loose weight exercising cutting out meals subliminals stretching facial massages walking and nothing makes a dent if anything i gain more how is it possible for me to gain more when i eat half what i ate at my lowest weight,1,114
eds are so dumb laugh my ass off sometimes i just b laughing at myself for having such a delusional little bitch mental disorder i am a grown ass woman i should b paying bills and starting a career but nooooooooo i have to spend every waking second of my day thinking about losing weight hating myself and literally just creating my own fucking problems,1,65
that look people give you when they see your food portions on days you just do not give a f i hate when i go to buffets and decide to just let loose and enjoy myself fully because i restrict so hard i eat so clean and so little so let me enjoy myself i always remember the comments like wow you are getting 4 slices of cake i am only getting 1 that is enough for me well no shit it is enough for you because you get to eat this stuff whenever you want i only have today to not care about macros or micros let me have my fill sorry rant over i just remember vividly some of the faces i got when i decide to try to be normal but ultimately my body craves the stuff i deprive it of i am so hungry that i do not feel ashamed of their glances though i am more annoyed than anything is it bad i have dreamt of punching my cousin in the face because of his comments woops,1,182
how do people believe those recovery accounts that stay extremely underweight for months on end or even just someone not gaining any weight at all but you are posting extreme hunger wieid for the past 5 months okrrrrf,1,38
recovered bulimic here what i wish someone would have told me hey there i have thought about writing something like this for a long time i have struggled with a heavy eating disorder since i was about 17 until i think about 24 to then be fully recovered at 28 i tried to stop eating which did not work for me and then developed severe bulimia i have thrown up so many times i cannot even remember i have missed so much in my life because i was completely wrapped up in this vicious cycle and i thought it was impossible to get out of it i thought i was incapable of ever getting over the feeling of eating attached to some sort of guilt or negative emotion it started out as a thing to lose weight but to be very honest it was never about weight what i have learned over the years is that an eating disorder actually masks something else hidden inside of us it was not my weight it was me being so incredibly insecure and unhappy with myself that bulimia was actually a slow way to try to kill myself i was too scared to kill myself so i tried to do it this way gradually it took over from morning to evening there was only one thing on my mind i would start out okay promised myself i would be good this day and then one little thing would push me over the edge i wanted to be healthy today but had to go eat at someone else s place so i would binge because it was all or nothing and i would throw up i cannot tell you how much money i have spent on buying food it go to a point where the cashier of my local super market in my student town laughed when i would not buy a litre of ice cream that day no ice cream today huh i obviously never visited that store again it felt like i constantly was carrying this heavy burden this secret i hated it i hated how i never was at ease like i always had a job to do after two years i confided in my mom that i had this problem she was relieved it was just that because she thought i had a drug problem she asked our doc about it who told her that if i did not lose any weight there was not any problem i am from a small village so whatever the doc said was the truth so my mother did not really bother and then i was sent off to college with a credit card that would be recharged whenever i would reached my limit i bought so much food the amount of food i ate and threw up litres of ice cream an entire bread cookies chips at certain moments i thought i was going to explode at the age of 22 23 i wrote a goodbye letter every night because i felt like i might die that night i felt like my heart might give up so i would write a letter in which i told my family i loved them and i was sorry whenever i would wake up i would tear them up and throw them in the bin i hated myself no one would have ever thought i was what society considers beautiful in shape but i was so miserable after a few years i just turned into a full addiction i tried to go to therapy but my parents made me feel guilty about it they would pay someone 8k to repaint their windows but they would make me feel guilty to waste 40 euros on therapy my mom would get tons of snacks in the house because i would have to learn to not touch them and resist temptation so i had to deal with it myself but there was no reason to stop there were no obvious side effects so why would i i once almost chocked on a pencil i tried to put in my throat to throw up i have scars on my fingers from throwing up but then it happened i was i think 22 23 and i had developed a habit of throwing up at least 3 times a day the hurt it was indescribable but then it got worse and i started throwing up blood the more i threw up the more blood there was in the toilet until this one night where i threw up so much blood the entire toilet seat was covered in blood there was blood everywhere and then it struck me i am going to die if i continue doing this all of this had always been such a far away intangible thing and then i realized maybe i did not want to die the consequences had become apparent i did not want to die strangely enough this was the only thing that scared me enough to not do it again from that night on i was so scared to ever throw up again because i had been hit in the face with the consequences i would write a goodbye note which would actually be my goodbye note if i did not stop i was so scared to throw up but the urges to binge eat where still there so i had to deal with it i binged and there i was lying on the couch struggling so nauseous i learned chewing gum helps a lot to digest every time i binged i took some chewing gums and tried to deal with the consequences of binge eating but i did not throw up anymore funnily enough this obviously caused some weight gain my parents both knew i had struggled with bulimia but pretended it was not there when i finally had managed to stop this monster but had gained some weight they started critiquing me how i had gained weight i explained why this happened but the critiquing did not stop my mom initially refused to let me go to a therapist when i still had bulimia but was more than happy to pay an expensive weight treatment where i would lose my weight up to my 30th birthday i have had fights with my parents to stop critiquing my weight at 26 27 i moved abroad i was in a different environment and was not interested in food for a few months i was not hungry it was the weirdest thing for the first time i was not interested in eating not from a toxic point of view but just i was not that hungry so i just started eating healthy big portions but just healthy foods after a few weeks something happened i was eating when i was hungry and i did not binge anymore the emotional eating still stuck with me for a few years but i hardly ever threw up and here we are i am 31 writing to you and i feel happier than i have ever feel before i wish someone would have told me that you can get over it it is never too late no matter what age you are i started doing therapy without my parents knowing but the truth is my bulimia only got better when i actually decided i wanted something to change i figured it was not about food it was not about being thin it was about me being so unhappy with myself and the consequences of what happened to me while growing up i was not confident i was not happy it took me years and years to conquer the bulimia work on myself and discover what was actually wrong i had very i mean very confrontational talks with my parents i threatened to break off all contact with them if they would not change their ways and they finally did sort of i decided that i was worth living for i discovered i had add and got help for that the reason why i am writing this is because i thought it was impossible to ever feel like this i am more in shape than i ever was and the funny thing is i do not do anything for it i stopped caring about the way people perceive me i tried to be at peace with myself it has been a hell of a journey and a long one but you can get over this it took me a long time to see what was really bothering me i actually enjoy food now it has become a necessity like sleep or going to the toilet if i see what i eat for dinner now my 21 year old self would have lost her mind a gigantic bowl of pasta but because i do not binge anymore i can do that when i was in my early twenties the consequences of what i was doing were so far removed from me now i am struggling with arthritis a weak stomach and a possible thyroid disease that has developed i wish i would have taken care of myself a bit better when i look back at pictures now i see a girl that was desperately looking for some love and wanted to be in control i have lost so much time i am 31 and i feel i am still figuring out life i sometimes feel i am in the phase of life any 25 year old is usually in but i tell people i lost 5 years of my life battling this monster i hope that whatever age you are whatever you are struggling with there is a light at the end of the tunnel there always is someone who cares someone who wants you to get better it is possible to get better and boy when you get there it feels so good i am rooting for you i am rooting for everyone of you like i would be rooting for my 21 year old self life is beautiful and you are too and you are deserve the world,1,1697
does anyone else feel like they have no life outside ed i feel like my ed is my only comfort but at the same time it makes progressing in life almost impossible i guess there is just no growth in comfort zone i used to have hobbies interest in school dreams even a couple of friends i was still unhappy sometimes and felt hopeless with my future but overall i was content with my life and those unhappy moments never lasted long now it is all turned around there is just me and my ed i still have my family but it feels like there is a crack in our relationship now that they know about my ed my biggest goal is that one day when i am ready i will leave this all behind and get my life back just not yet does anyone else feel this way like your ed kind of robbed your life or do you still function well in your life despite ed what is your ultimate goal with your ed,1,176
you do not need to starve yourself anymore you are already so skinny i had an intake appointment with a therapist last week and multiple times during the appointment she told me how skinny i looked and how pretty i was and that i did not need to starve myself because i already looked great she even asked me to rate myself out of 100 in comparison to everyone else in the world this was my first and last appointment with this therapist because what the actual fuck first of all nobody let alone a therapist specializing in treating eating disorders should be commenting on other people s bodies second why the hell would you tell someone with an eating disorder that is been starving themselves that they look great because they are already skinny if i was not skinny would that justify me having an eating disorder if i look good and am skinny now would not i look better if i was even skinner so should not i starve myself more if i look great right now then i should not recover because if i did i would gain weight which based on what she is telling me would be a bad thing this is the fucked up logic of someone with an ed that she clearly is not attuned to finally basing my opinion of myself on how attractive i am compared to other people is mean and fucked up a i should not be basing my self worth on how i look and b i definitely should not be tearing other people down just to make myself feel better x200b my former therapist dropped me a month ago because i have been struggling with an ed and finding a new one has been really tough especially since i have to weed through bullshit like this,1,309
fuck pasta if you are a pasta noodle and you are reading this kindly go fuck yourself,1,17
long term effects of laxative abuse i came by my ed honest my grandma my mom and aunt and i have all had disordered eating at some point or throughout our lives when i lived with my grandma i was a chubby 13 year old at 130 lbs through ephedrine laxatives soup diets waist training and restricted eating i got down to 104 in 2 months i still feel like i was bad at having an ed because my bmi was actually always normal now i am 31 and i think i am better whenever i diet or skip meals i worry that i am disordered again i constantly ask my doctor and therapist if what i am doing is ok the worst though is shitting i cannot fucking shit normally because of abusing laxatives for so long i used to use magnesium but my doctor hs me on miralax and stool softeners and fiber and i still need to use the occasional glycerin suppository these are dependency forming but if i do not i get stopped up so i am fucking dependent either way i also have to take simethicone cos trapped gas hurts like a bitch my five year old son has bigger shits than me i do not know what my point is here i guess it is just something i live with that no one in my real life understands i stopped using laxatives regularly over 13 years ago when i would hide them in the underwear of a doll my dad brought me back from cuba or in a pair of shoes or the seam of a jacket literally hiding it like i did pot and pills thanks to my doctor i shit most days but it is a bitch if i do not use the miralax for more than a couple days thanks,1,309

my eating disorder makes me an awful person i am remembering who i was before my relapse i was insecure in my body sure but i was a much more positive presence in people s lives i was present i was sweet i was able to support others i was not nearly as judgmental i did not push everyone away even though i was fat i was a much nicer person overall but now i am horrible i judge people who have done nothing to me i am irritated by the mere presence of someone who is more attractive than me i catch myself judging what people are eating all the time and i fucking hate myself for it i am literally afraid of people doing the same to me and yet i am doing it to others what the fuck i feel like snapping at everyone especially my mom i isolate myself i do not want anyone to notice me emotionally i am a she will of the person i was i barely feel anything anymore sometimes it feels like all of my aspirations have vanished into thin air they are replaced with the thought of how much i am looking forward to my next bowl of oatmeal i am a huge fucking liar everything i do feels like a sham to hide what is going on under the surface i do not like this new version of myself but i do not know how to stop it maybe i have been this way all along and the ed is bringing it out maybe i have been a bitch this whole time but now i feel okay to express it maybe now that i am prettier i do not need to compensate by being nice anymore i think i know where this came from my ed voice tells me that i am worthless that people only want me for emotional support or so that they can go to sleep at night being grateful that they are not fat and disgusting like me they want me to be their ugly friend people look out for themselves first my eating disorder is my only true friend it just wants me to be a better version of myself while everyone else wants me to be the version of myself that suits them i know how fucked this line of thinking is but a part of me wholeheartedly believes that it is true,1,410
question different phases in ed cycles is it normal too go throught phases in you are ed where you just do not care anymore have lost the reason too restrict or engage in ed behaviours and r just kind of normal for a few weeks i feel like i feel so much more when i am restricting or purging and so on even if its mainly shitty feelings and thoughts but the past 2 weeks or so all i have done is basically binge eat or eat normally with no compensatory behaviours i just feel so numb my life so bland that i do not really care right now too cry over it anymore or too franticly restrict the next day its not like this does not make me hella uncomfortable i just feel nothing no good or bad emotions just uncomfortableness worry my ed is slipping away not caring enough on either side too continue restriction or eating normally i cycle alot throught different phases like p b pure restriction over excersize lax abuse etc but right now i am not really doing any of that for the past two weeks and i am scared my ed has gone or smth ik its not really true the thoughts r there there is still things i refuse too eat and behaviours i use i feel disgusting am planning on how too loose the weight but i just feel nothing right now its causing me too not care enough about if i am gaining etc is this just part of a cycle do other people with eds kind of sometimes go too a point of remission i do not know what too call it i feel so guilty and fake because the emotional response of my actions is not there right now but its not there with anything my entire life feels like this i do not know i just need help,1,321
can people like stop fucking asking me what i ate having to talk about food especially out loud is fucking disgusting and humiliating do not make me talk about this shit it is unnecessary annoying and makes me re live the fucking horrible experience of eating over and over again,1,50
now i realize how consuming this is food calories not eating starving working out losing weight numbers etc they all stay in my brain all hours of the day and at first it was not that bad i was like oh i am losing weight this is just the healthy diet mindset no i was wrong that has to be wrong because i feel anxious and stressed all the time and really consumed by whatever this is i do not really say i have an eating disorder i ignore that topic as much as possible disordered eating though recent overwhelming thoughts doing online school atleast i am not eating maybe typing burns cals showering put it colder to burn more cals i do hot and cold on and off for my sanity i hate it it is uncomfortable and not fun working out just 10 more which is repeatedly said until i cannot breathe or move much and the biggest and most stressful one for me right now is sleeping dreaming of not eating dreaming of not consuming calories dreaming of body checks i cannot escape this i am so upset,1,191
does anyone else get lazy with their ed i have not been disordered that long and my first experience with an ed was last year i am relapsing right now and it is so different from the first time i was disordered like i used to exercise and only eat clean foods etc and now i just cba i eat whatever i want while watching my calories i do not exercise but i am still losing weight part of me is glad but another part of me is like why the hell was i doing all of that work before when i could have just taken it easy and still lost weight it can also be pretty invalidating because my brain is like oh you are not really disordered because you are not doing exactly what you did last time you eat like a normal person now so you cannot be relapsing does anyone else go through different phases with their ed,1,162
the scariest thing about restricting for me the scariest thing about restricting is how i do not really take notice of anything while i am restricting i have been learning to drive and the amount of nearly crashing mounting the curb and doing manoeuvres only to realise afterwards that i was 100 sure it was safe to do is scary even when i am walking and have to cross the road i have been nearly hit by countless cars in the last few weeks it is not like i do not look or pay attention either i do i just seem not to be able to process what i am seeing or looking out for i do not know if this makes much sense but yeah beyond the obvious health impacts and risk of death from my ed this is probably the scariest immediate about restricting,1,146
if you had a device that could show the exact calorie count of everything that went into your body along with showing exactly how many calories you have consumed that day would you be stressed out by it or would it calm you down,1,44

ah the joy of having a round broad wide face how am i supposed to ever recover from my ed when my face always makes me look as if i am chubby af i cannot even hope that it is simply a side effect of purging it is clearly my bone structure oof,1,53
does anyone else do age regression putting because i am not sure but i feel like i am acting more and more like a child because of my ed right now it is mostly in the way i dress it gets cuter and fluffier and all and i love looking like a life size doll believe it or not people treat me better when i wear lolita stuff but i also find myself wanting to drink from a baby bottle and stuff like this does that happen to some of you to i just find the idea of acting looking like a child very comforting just to feel more vulnerable and small,1,112
i miss treatment part of me wants to relapse so bad just so that i can go back to treatment i miss being really really sick i miss being thin and frail and fragile i miss the comfort of just having to focus on one thing every day the real world is stressful and terrifying and i miss that cozy bubble where all you had to do was not die there is a part of me that really romanticizes that early recovery stage i want it all back everything was so simple,1,92
the feminine urge to isolate myself from everyone and everything and binge restrict,1,13
do not appropriate vents into ana or mia advice do not make vents that can be turnt to ana or mia advice do not take meds that do not belong to you do not do dangerous medical interventions because skinny i am kind of upset at saying this because i often just want to vent my frustrations and voice possible harm reduction but it will be turnt into some pro ed bs recently i vented about how long i have to wait to be able to get certain medication where a side effect is weight loss from loss of appetite and nausea and depression a fellow ed bitch went out and stole said medication from their relative and went to me like it did not work this medication is highly controlled and i was surprised they did not have heart palpitations and anxiety attacks bitch i was not giving you advice i do not want anything i say to be turnt into some ana or mia coach shit i am just trying to vent do not steal medication that is not for you do not take medication if you do not need it it makes me feel like shit for voicing my own frustrations also do not do a certain medical technique that empties the stomach not going to say the name because i do not want people who do not know what i am talking about seeking out how to do it it may seem like harm prevention but it is not it will just make purging more frequent and more dangerous my toxocology teachers had so many stories of patients dying because of sudden electrolyte imbalances medical professionals killed patients accidentally with this technique do not do it the risk is too damn high all in all i feel like vents are just good for the soul but in the end can because more harm similar to when people post before after recovery pics that will be appropriated by ed bitches as thinspo,1,335
for the first time i looked at a video of me at my highest weight and i did not hate her and that hurt a lot i was beautiful i looked good and confident i know i was not but yeah and the only reason i feel okay saying that is because i do not recognise her which is honestly scary i feel like i am watching a video of a stranger and i am not sure what my point is but it just hurt a lot i have never viewed myself like that i have always wanted to see myself from another persons perspective and for a second there i feel like i did i just saw myself as human i cannot even explain it well but i keep watching the video and sobbing i did not deserve to hate myself so much and put myself through so much pain and i know i did not choose to have an ed but and despite that belief i am still hating myself today even though i try not to and i am still so consumed by my ed and the desire to lose more weight sorry i just needed to share that because i stg something broke in me just now,1,211
how many of you developed an ed because of other people s unnecessary comments for me it was definitely because people like my mom aunt members of my family and one or two friends commented that i gained weight and now have too much fat on my bones after my doctor told me to gain weight lol really goes to show how much comments from other people can affect you like people should just not comment on other people s weight it is not that hard you do not know their situation ugh,1,93

i am from norway and we have this tradition called the almond in the porridge you all get a bowl of porridge and the one who gets the almond hidden in one of them gets a marzipan pig or some other type of candt and it is just funny to me how i always used to calculate the chances of me getting it depending on how many people we were around the table and if i did not win i would get visibly upset and this year i am calculating the chanses of me not getting it and i will legit cry if i win the marzipan,1,107

i hate being able to feel my body i am looking for some advice or guidance or something i am having a very hard time with feeling hating my body on a visceral level i do not want it to exist i feel trapped by it it feels like a violation or something right now i cannot stand being touched or thinking about being touched or anything this is not really about feeling fat or at least not only about that but feeling detached and burdened by the concept of a body i actually feel bad for my body because i do not think it deserve the animosity but these feelings are making my restrictive ed and sh really awful and borderline dangerous has anyone felt this or have a name for it,1,133
in pain from forcing myself to walk every single day but my therapist thinks it is a great thing to do i will admit that i went overboard a couple days ago and walked 27000 steps when i usually only average 10 12000 steps but seeing my reflection in the mirror distressed me so much that i felt like i had to do something about it right then and there since that day the bone on the inner side of my leg hurts a lot but that did not stop me from forcing myself to walk the usual daily steps i walk to the store buy heavy things like water bottles and carry them in my backpack hoping that the extra weight will make me burn more calories for the same distance it is been a few months now and it seems like i will have to get used to the constant pain the worst thing is that my thighs are the exact same size as they always were at this specific weight  i do not look any different and i am not losing weight any faster i only took a break from walking for about 6 months after i herniated my back and as a result i gained 20lbs and lost all my muscle binge eating could not walk but since then i have been putting all this effort and i do not see any results even before my back injury walking seemed useless but i was too scared to stop i talked to my therapist about it but he insists i should not stop walking because it is a great way to relieve stress and take a break from my responsibilities but walking feels like a responsibility on its own regardless of how bad the weather is or how tired i am i have to force myself to walk if not outside the house then i walk back and forth in my apartment until i see the magic number on my tracker when i expressed to him how walking for me is just a way to burn calories and that is why i do it definitely not for the health benefits as in my opinion it hurts my body he insisted that if i stop my anxiety levels will go up and binge eating might get worse so will purging which i am trying so hard to stop i do not know what to do at this point other than accepting my fate,1,415

i pooped i have been hella constipated for 4 days and finally found something that works i was so desperate i literally tried everything all the exercises and anything non lax that i could but i found this technique online and thank god lol so you put a hand at the top of your stomach and slowly push all the way down to your pelvic bone do it like 5 times your stomach should gurgle a bit and it actually worked i was so shocked i do not know if this is common knowledge but i surely did not know it xd i know you all struggle with this too so thought i would share maybe you can poop too,1,120

one way or another i need to be accountable so i am writing here that i am not going to binge this weekend because if i binge then i purge and i do not want to purge not anymore purging is horrible and is ruining my body restriction is hard enough but purging on top of that is just something i need to s t o p i am going to still restrict but not massively and i am not going to binge weekends are problematic for me because i do not have work distracting me i have plenty of time and i am hungry and i do not know what to do it is cold dark and snowy out there so going for walks is not a good idea either and i am basically stuck inside all day thinking about food but i am not going to binge please let this be the reality please let me be strong enough for two fucking days,1,165

night sweats not recovery has anyone else experienced night sweats with a restrictive ed i see that they are common in recovery but i am not quite there i wake up drenched a few nights a week,1,37
weird messages does anyone else get weird messages from dudes like i am basically only active on this sub which makes me wonder if there is dudes going through this sub trying to find vulnerable girls to message,1,38
honestly the most frustrating part of my ed the weakness obviously sucks and the total control and consequent lack of control around food of course but i find myself so insanely rigid about my routines it is hard to enjoy my friends and family as much as i should i am sure you have all heard this a thousand times but eds make life feel so small when do i eat next what do i eat next and how much how long is my next fast will this restaurant have any safe foods how long will i be away from my apartment where all my safe foods are etc this is me venting and wondering if anyone finds this to be one of the more tragic parts of their ed,1,130
does anyone else go to the supermarket as a stress reliever i have been pretty stressed the past few weeks and this week a lot of things have compounded together and lead me to basically wanting to curl up in a ball for the foreseeable so i am off to the supermarket later i have not been yet this week it is my biggest stress reliever it is like i need to go just to feel balanced and normal again i walk around for a while buy the food for my family and then come home it is amazing and makes me feel human especially at this time of the year when they have all their holiday stock out does anyone else feel like this,1,125
you know what is pissing me off i pretty much only crave healthy foods anymore nuts eggs fruit right now i am craving a salad kit that we have upstairs in the fridge i am craving a fucking salad kit this tells me that they are not boredom cravings it is all healthy shit because my body is screaming at me to give it those nutrients and yet i just do not i cannot not until i reach some arbitrary number of stockpiled uneaten calories to counteract the stockpiled overeaten calories that i am still holding onto from last month because unless i pay for the overeating i will not be able to complete the insane edblr diet i am doing this shit is wild man,1,126
just do it recovery was the best move ever i feel alive again and i want to kiss people again hell yeah also my curves,1,25
is it just me or is this sub getting more pro am i crazy i feel like it used to be more strictly moderated but i am seeing more and more posts about tips and things like that,1,38
rant my so always ties eating with exercise and make me guilt because i do not want like to go to the gym so i feel guilt every single time i want to eat something my brain considers a treat and so it happens that my so will always try to guilt trip me into going to the gym so i kind of can eat what i want normally the conversation goes let us buy some pizza will you go to the gym with me today and this always makes me feel like shit as if i can only eat something other than oatmeal with salt when i promise that yes i will go to the gym even if i hate it with all my guts does not matter if i made two hours on the bike it does not matter if i danced walked restricted for days every time i ask for something good it will be accompanied by this fucking remark i told him that it is bullshit and to stop doing it but he kind of said no it is not like that and that pretty much i am crazy and making shit up and it is storming and beating things up around the house while making me take the blame for making him feel like shit i am so tired just wanted to eat stuff without both my mind and the people around me making pay for it,1,242
does anyone else miss ana buddies but not like the coaches just someone that can relate to why i want to cry over a bowl of broccoli casserole because my in real life friends think i am insane for being anxious over dinner,1,43

i am once again asking how i can help my sister who has an eating disorder she got sent to the hospital a while ago and got transferred to the psych ward she is currently home with us but she has a meal plan and if she does not respect 100 of it she will be sent home our parents are constantly yelling at her and making her eat things that are not on the plan and threatening to send her back to the hospital if she does not it really upsets her how can i support her,1,98
i wish my life did not center around food watching people deal with food casually and not make eating or not eating a main part of their day to day life that is what i want i do not know if i will ever have it again,1,47
i am having such a good morning and i just need to tell someone i am not exactly in recovery but i woke up feeling bad this morning but instead of restricting or going to b p i just made myself a normal comfort breakfast without tracking or restricting i lit a candle put some cafe music on and made myself a regular sized bowl of oats with toppings and sat down to draw as i ate breakfast and i am content maybe even happy i kind of want to cry because i wish i could do this every morning but it is just another thing my ed takes from me i moved out for uni a few months ago and ever since living alone i think i have eaten like 2 normal meals max it is been either restricting or binging purging and it is been hard so i appreciate any little break i get from my ed it is so hard though because i know this would not always make me feel better and it is hard to find that balance like some days not tracking would make me feel a lot worse but it is just what i needed today and i am glad i am feeling okay about it so yeah i just wanted to share and tell someone here is your reminder to appreciate the little things ew laughing out loud sorry if that is corny but it is true romanticise parts of your life if you can not your ed because even though it is hard to see a lot of the time life can be beautiful and life can be okay 3 i love all of you and hope you have a good or at least okay day,1,295
can anyone else literally not deal with hunger maybe it is because i am underweight or maybe it is because i have been restricting for so long but can anyone else not deal with hunger anymore i cannot even wait a few extra minutes to eat anymore when i get hungry i either start crying or feel like i am going to faint i have panic attacks in school because i will be so hungry but it is not lunch time yet so i will have to hide in the bathroom so i can actually eat something sometimes my family is about to go out to eat but my hunger becomes so intense that i end up eating a full meal beforehand instead of a snack and then i am not even hungry so i just stay home this is really frustrating to me because i wish i could be more flexible but if i do not have access to food now i absolutely freak the fuck out i nearly had a panic attack this morning because we ran out of food at my house that i am okay with eating which means i will have to eat school lunch today but that is 7 hours away from breakfast i do not know how i will make it that long,1,220
cannot do this no mo i am done eating like 1500 calories a day for a while i am going to get fat for a couple months and see all the foods this world has to offer i cannot live my life eating the same shit forever i know i can eat whatever but 1500 that is like one fucking fast food meal man i do not want to let myself go but the urge to just not give a fuck is stronger than my urge to be skinny right now my appetite is not even that huge i am just tired of stressing about my next meal every damn day wake me up in a couple weeks,1,118
why do people feel the need to tell you how long they have gone without eating everyone around me is so triggering my mom likes to constantly tell me how long she is gone without eating and how many calories she is eaten i accidentally yelled at her but i could not even say why i was upset because then she would know my close friend always tells me about her eating habits when she is very much aware of my eating disorder today we were at lunch and she said it was the best food she is ever had because she has not eaten in x about of days i feel like shit i have been binging for months straight,1,121
ok i have seen why people will not go all in with recovery but why not go all in with your ed what is stopping you whatever that means up to you c for me i do not want to pass out walking up the stairs of my school and possibly die with people around actually better if i die so i will not have to deal with the embarrassment and confrontation if i live lol maybe the hair loss too since i already had a little amount of it before developing an ed my sleep has been shitty so i do not want to be more tired than i already am,1,112
10 years since rock bottom hi all i just wanted to jump in here to share some recovery positivity hope this is ok to post december this year marks 10 years from my ed rock bottom at the time i never thought things would get better and it took a while for things to improve for me as you can imagine such a big anniversary brings with it lots of thoughts what if i had never recovered what if i had done this or this instead of entering treatment but instead of letting them in i am focusing on what i have right now i am still here 10 years later and thriving i still have some struggles the 10 years has not been an easy ride i honestly doubt i will ever be able to say i am 100 recovered and free from disordered thoughts but it gets so much easier to overcome them that is for sure but i am here i am healthy i am doing well and i just want you all to know that i truly believe you are all worthy of the happiness i feel now you are all worthy of being well and taking care of yourselves i needed to hear that 10 years ago and luckily over the years i have learnt it for myself i wish you all the best wherever you are in your journeys i hope one day you are all looking back on 10 years of recovery too x,1,251
chose not the run today part of my ed is my major running addiction but recently i have been injured and running has been slow and painful for me today i decided to not run and while i am still going to follow a pamela reif youtube video this is a huge win for me tomorrow is a full rest day,1,61
christmas affirmations i will not be brought to tears by the size tag on any clothing type gifts i will not be desperately planning compensatory behaviours for any food eaten i will be enjoying festive cheer i will be unfazed by any talk of dieting,1,45
just came home from college and the first thing my mom said to me was you got chunky not to mention after my dad picked me up he said i got fat and my bf before i left la to come back home told me i should lose some weight all i can say is thank you to them though because now i am on a mission to make my ed come back even worse and lose as much as i possibly can,1,83
who else s ed stems from their mental illness god so i got diagnosed with bipolar 1 with psychosis and spent 2 months in a psych hospital and as is common with any antipsychotics mood stabilisers they make you a zombie and super hungry so i went from 67 7 to 82kg in a few months gained 32 pounds now i have lost 6 kg 13 pounds in the last few months from restricting to almost normal healthy restricting amounts 1200 1500 but am now doing 700 a day i feel like total shit and i lost 2 pounds more this week and i have 7 weeks more of restriction before i need to go back to college and i want all this hospital weight zombie fat meds weight gone but fuck i cannot do anything around the house get out of bed do anything and my mother is complaining i have become a vegetable and i need to eat more so i can do things like yes but i will be able to do things again in 7 weeks when i have finally lost 13 more pounds fuck i just feel like had i never gotten medicated i would have never gotten fat and then resorted to ed territory to lose weight because i have only got 10 more weeks until college resumes tl dr mental illness makes me fat low restrict to lose weight family unhappy weight loss is the only thing getting me out of my depression,1,250

period loss question is the loss of your period a side effect of malnutrition restricting regardless of your weight or of being underweight so is it possible to lose your period if you are restricting but overweight,1,37
i have never fainted and given that is the quintessential ed experience in every lifetime movie i feel like i have never been sick enough there are many times where i put my body through the ringer enough that it absolutely should but it just will not i have this ed and pots and have never in my life passed out does anyone else get imposter syndrome from petty shit like this,1,72
fck ed i am going to start recovery fuck this shit i do not want to make my family cry over my disordered behaviors anymore i want my life back i want my family to be happy i want to be free once for all hope you all would make better ly i think that the best is leaving this sub as a first step wish me luck i just made a pizza and i am going to eat that,1,80
i am a hypocritical parent not me telling my picky 7yo that they should eat all their food so they can grow big and strong i feel like a bad parent i want so badly for my kids to have a good relationship with food but i do not know how because obv it is not my strong point,1,59
how to approach this situation hey you all so i have an adult coworker who has a 7 year old daughter it came up in conversation today that her daughter has begun counting calories on food packages is self conscious about her body i guess she is in gymnastics went to practice in a sports bra came home wearing a shirt because she did not like her stomach that day she also works out on top of her gymnastics so it is not my daughter this is only the first i am hearing of the situation but i am concerned because of how close to home it hits my anorexia started at 12 it started with the counting calories the mom was definitely at least a little concerned expressing how the daughter is already skinny does not need to be counting calories whatnot i did briefly express how i dealt with similar at 12 really encouraged her to nudge the daughter in the direction of fueling her body rather than obsessing but like i really feel like i should say more i do not want to overstep tell her how to parent but in all honesty if she is already counting calories at seven it is kind of already too late in my opinion like whatever triggered it has already happened whether it is a social media post or something a girl at gymnastics said we all know it does not just happen i would give anything to go back to 12 year old me not fall down that hole what happened at 12 is going to affect me the rest of my life i just relapsed ended up in the hospital at 20 it makes me tearful thinking about the vulnerable and impressionable position that girl is in right now that could leave her in the same place does anyone have advice on how i could tactfully express my concern is it even my place to say any more what all should i say if i do say something to clarify like said the mom knows it is not healthy behavior i am just not sure she understands the implications of what it leads to,1,366
today i cancelled plans with friends because food was involved and then started bingeing out of frustration so stupid,1,19
pov you are going to the school compost bin to throw away your lunch and you see someone else already there doing the same thing alfkdjaljfalsjf lkdj i really hope they are okay but i feel them,1,37
does anyone else feel like they cannot relate to many posts because you are very uw accepting death i want to hear from you i guess it makes sense if the statistic is only 6 of people with eating disorders are underweight i really do appreciate and resonate with all your posts and have really enjoyed the safe place and interactions but wanted to make my own post i know i look awful but i do not want to stop losing weight i do not look hot anymore i do not look like anyone else i look like a child i was thinking today the only person that would fall for me would have to be a fetishist right i am letting this disease kill me i cannot scroll through tiktok without feeling like shit that i look nothing like the hot young queers anymore for some reason my ed makes me feel incapable of expressing myself with my appearance well other than to express my illness fatigue it is like i only have the energy to dress like an exhausted stay at home mom does that even make sense i mean like rewearing the same yoga pants large cardigan and a ratty tshirt i really wish there was an in person meeting in my city i feel so alone the only meeting left that i actually tried to attend ended after the leader moved there is a surprising lack of accessibility to ed support or treatment in philly but i guess that is unfortunately everywhere anyways i love you all and thank you for hearing me,1,267
lack of ed representation in black poc in no way am i saying there should be more black poc who develop eds what i am saying is that black poc very much have eds and need more stories told by them whether that is in films television books etc i looked up short films films shows about black people and eds and i only came across one which was very good by the way eds are not just being battled by skinny white girls they are being battled by all sizes races genders and ages all in all eds do not discriminate,1,102
will overeating for a few days make me gain tons of weight i hope this is okay to ask but i really need some reassurance obviously christmas is next week and after my fair share of shitty holidays thanks to my ed and a pretty terrible year also equally thanks to my ed i have decided that i want to try and enjoy christmas this year i am a pretty strict and obsessive calorie counter i have been restricting under 1000 kcals for most of my ed and that is what i have been doing the last 2 months since getting out of treatment my guilt after eating anything has been so bad recently and it is been a struggle to eat about 700 a lot of days so cannot be doing wonders for my metabolism i am also uw and short so my bmr tdee are not that high my plan this year was to take 3 or so days off of calorie counting christmas eve christmas day boxing day on christmas eve my mum always bakes an apple cake to have with some cream for breakfast i have got some medical appointments to go to and really want to take her out for a festive hot chocolate afterwards we tend to have something easy for dinner like going out to eat or a take away all of these things i have not been able to join in on for years christmas day more apple cake and pastries for breakfast a buffet style starter with cheese and bread etc a big roast dinner as the main and then a selection of different puddings later in the evening on top of various snacks stollen cake mince pies chocolates and alcohol boxing day tends to be the day of leftovers normally involving a buffet style meal of them i really want to enjoy the day spend time with my family and take part in the food i am really worried that eating over my tdee for these 3 days is going to make me gain a ton of weight and that i will not be able to deal with it i know logically that probably is not the case but really i am just looking for some reassurance and i guess permission that it is okay to try and let go on my ed and enjoy the festivities i have missed out on for years,1,404
ed really makes it difficult to experience and enjoy romantic sexual intimacy the longing is definitely there i want to be cuddled and held and kissed everywhere and that is exactly what the problem is i cannot bear the thought of someone looking at me and touching my horrific body i would feel so ashamed and pathetic i would even pity whoever next has to see me without clothes on i am not and never have been beautiful and it shows and it is true and i am just so stuck i have never been in love and now approaching 30 years old i have never been in a real relationship all i have to show is disordered eating and hiding and like a million other embarrassing secrets i wish i was just normal and healthy and emotionally open and ready for real intimacy it is a vodka night for sure so i can just zone out for a bit this post brought to you by having to attend a wedding this weekend,1,173
i bought binge food but only ate a small portion of it i actually feel okay and comfortable and do not feel the need to eat more,1,27
does anyone feel okay ish about certain foods when buying them yet feel horrible when you actually have to eat them i am super pissed because i found a low cal ice cream that is delicious is sold in small enough tubs that eating it all is not a big deal when it comes to my calorie limit and a bystander probably would not think it is something a disordered person would eat right i bought a few tubs of it and was super excited about a guilt free pleasurable thing to eat but now that it is in my freezer it is like the nutrition label was completely different a switch flipped and now i stare at it and do not feel okay eating it why cannot the ed brain make up its mind,1,135
i am getting help you all i am doing it i committed i told my job i needed medical leave i am flying across the country in a month to help myself all on my own dime i will not let this rob another year of my life yes i am terrified no i am not ready but if i do not recover now this will kill me i want to see the world i want a family someday i want to meet more people and stop thinking about food 24 7 i am not sure of many things but this decision is the right one the most important realization i have come to is that i am doing this for me and not for anyone else i will make an awesome life for myself this will not define me anymore fuck eating disorders if it means putting on a third of my body weight to have my mind back i need to accept that my brain is more far more valuable than my body update my cost of treatment just got 40 percent cheaper thanks to financial aid holy shit,1,191
does anyone else buy clothes that do not fit them hoping it will motivate you to get skinnier i just thrifted this super cute pair of brown jeans that fit me super well but they are low waisted so you can see my belly rolls this is not the first time i have bought clothes thinking i will grow into them too i hope this is not just me,1,69
does anyone else obsess over prime numbers and odd numbers there is an overlap of my ocd into my ed where certain numbers are safe and others are infuriating i hate most even numbers do not want to see them or even hear about them one of my gw is 97 pounds and it is especially pleasing to me because at 5 3 it puts my bmi at 17 2 which is all prime and also low enough to be diagnosed with ana it is borderline embarrassing how much i dream of it though i doubt i will ever make it there and maintain it,1,105
handling all the you look healthy comments after being at my lowest point a year ago was severely underweight severely i would rather people not comment on anything related to my f cking body makes me want to restrict even more,1,41
thank you jason i have posted before about my now ex boyfriend who would scream at and belittle me while drunk well i left after 2 years i packed up all my things left everything i know and moved from new york city to fl to my mother she moved down about 3 years ago and what better way to jump back into restriction than heartbreak i cannot keep food down i cannot even look at food without immediately feeling sick down about 10 pounds in a week thanks jason i needed this,1,93
all in works for everyone if it did not work for you you are the problem this seems to be the popular opinion nowadays what happened to there is no one best way to recover i think this sentiment ignores the fact that all in is fucking hard and not everyone has the support needed to go through with it some people have trouble eating enough due to their jobs some people have gi issues due to other health problems i think it is so harmful to put all of the blame on the person for the method not working all in is not realistic for everyone maybe in a perfect universe everyone with anorexia could listen to their mental and physical hunger until they fully heal but that is not the reality that we live in all in did not work for me and it was not my fault it triggered behaviors that i would never done before i refuse to view them as normal thankfully i was able to stop but i can only hope that other people who did not have luck with this method are not told that it is their fault that their very distressing behaviors are not trivialized,1,204
eating food makes me want to die every time i eat something i regret it like no other the full feeling i have after makes me just want to end it all and self harm my therapist recommends i go to an ed facility but i am scared based off of the horror stories i have heard i just want to stop feeling and thinking this way but also a part of me has become immune to the self torture this is my first time posting on here so sorry if my thoughts are convoluted i just needed to rant somewhere,1,101
guess who just got yelled and force fed by their mum man my ear still hurts from being pulled well who caresthis totally cured me i am so normal now no more edfeeling disgusting af and wanting to rip my guts stomach out i love it when family members are understanding and supportive,1,53
i hate ed recovery tiktoks bcs i do not want to stop whenever i scroll through the ed tag on tiktok i get annoyed and angry seeing recovery posts i do not want to watch someone eat a cheeseburger or baked goods and tell me how they feel so much better i do not want to see your before and after pics i want to see thin girls and veggie bowls and smoothies i just want to dig myself deeper and at the same time i am screaming for someone to pull me out,1,94
i forgot other people do not have food and calories and weight on their mind 24 7 maybe i do have a problem i do not talk about it to anyone because i am in a healthy weight and when my parents found my sort of diary they did not understand because they do see me eat i write daily meal plans i never follow but i feel so ashamed that i let food be the only thing in my mind i have not even lost any weight i have been in the same weight almost the entire time not even yoyoing that much but it consumes my mind my every thought i am missing out on life i am 18 and i should look forward to more things in life i do not know how to ask for help and i never ever talk about my feelings,1,148
have you ever been so full that you are stomach physically hurt i had about 2650 calories in 4 hours and i have been fasting a lot i tried to lie on my stomach and cldnt breath it is not that bad it is just kind of funny,1,48
went back to dancing for the first time in two years last night and some guy pointed out i would gained weight i left before the class started i danced salsa and bachata for five years and though i have had mixed experiences with the community as a whole i have made some great friends and really valued my time there plus i love dancing i self isolated a lot over the past two years and i would put on weight which made me want to isolate more i finally made myself go back to dancing because it was good exercise and it is healthy to be social plus i missed some of my friends before class a few people come up to welcome me back and say hello some people i know fairly well others i just recognise them from class and dancing with them so i am polite but do not engage a man from the second group came up to me welcomed me back and then immediately noted i would put weight on wtf why would anyone say that why would anyone lead with that hey there i have not seen you in two years you have put on weight oh my god fuck off so then warm up starts for the first class and i try but all i can feel is my body jiggling i feel like i am some swollen monster and that everyone can see it i know that is not how it is but i could not complete the warm up i had to go outside and breathe just tell myself it is ok class then starts and i go to take my place in the circle but i cannot bear to it is a partner dance but i cannot have some touch me like this i feel disgusting and even if i am not i cannot just smile and joke cannot focus on what is happening i leave the circle grab my stuff and step outside two minutes later i am gone racing home i cannot check my phone because i know a few people that were excited for me to be there are going to message me they did and say nice things but also be disappointed that i left so quickly but i cannot reply to them cannot explain and i do not want pity the worst part is that on the way home i stopped and bought junk i was going to try and be good but i just ended up eating crap and hating myself for it today i have barely eaten anything just liquids and i feel better even though i know that is not good for me too i wanted to go dancing last night so i could remind myself so i could then go to the salsa christmas party this saturday and see everyone that i have been missing for two years now i wanted to start going regularly again two or three times a week i cannot dance when i am not eating though or when i am eating junk i am just too tired and i hate myself too much all because some guy i barely even know and have no interest in knowing makes a joke,1,545
the reason i am scared to recover again round face i hope this is not triggering but yeah i want to recover so bad but when i was in the peak of my recovery i was still uw my face was so round and bloated and i looked like a fat ugly child even though my body was still very uw looking now since i relapsed i have a nice pretty face shape and look actually so so pretty and now i compulsively take pictures of my face to make sure i do not look like back then and panic a lot about this,1,104
losing gf because of my ed this is a vent so it might be triggering disclaimer my gf has an ed as well and we both struggle with self harm yesterday my girlfriend texted me saying that she wants to prioritise her mental health over our relationship and that i either recover or we break up and that caught me very off guard and since i have never even considered recovery i told her that i need time to think and she said that if i need time to think then that means we are breaking up and we did the thing is i absolutely see her point and being in a relationship with someone who also has an ed is just no good unless you are both in recovery but also being forced to recover and being upset when i say that i need time to think is just so i do not know and to be honest if i go into recovery at this point in time then i will 100 relapse very badly because i am not mentally stable enough to deal with such feelings at the moment and to re build a normal relationship with food we broke up and she texted me this morning clarifying that we are done for good this time and i just said that i have got nothing to say anyways i am such a shitty person for choosing my ed over her,1,242
bye the random intense urge to tell anyone and everyone about my ed and every little fucked up thing i do to myself,1,23
guys i think i am finally doing it i have been struggling with bulimia for 7 years now i am 21 it all started with nothing tastes as good as skinny feels when i was 13 lost a bunch of weight and then slipped into bulimia which kind of ruined my life or at least made me go through hell i had no hope left inside of me i felt dead truly dead anyway for the first time in forever i am letting it slowly go it is not gone from one day to another it is been months a couple of days of getting better and then getting worse then a couple of weeks and then two weeks of getting worse but i used to b p every single fucking day multiple times a day i spent sooo much money on food now i go days without even thinking about binging and the best part i am realizing i can eat i can eat without getting fat i can eat a lot i can eat junk food i am so lucky in the sense that my appetite is balancing out accordingly i feel like i am over eating and then i step on the scale and i lost a little weight but overall i have been maintaining perfectly for over a year at a bmi of 21 perfectly heathy it is a new life honestly i still have a lot of the same struggles i still have battles to fight but bulimia is not weighing me down every step i am getting better i eat foods i enjoy i workout not excessively not to the point of not being able to move anymore just normally because it makes me feel better i am not fully recovered but i am so much better and i am so fucking greatful like sooo fucking grateful i feel like i am slowly escaping this hell,1,322
anyone else kind of scared of drinking water i know water has no calories and it is an irrational feeling but sometimes i would not let myself drink water for a short while because of the gain i might get,1,40
chinese takeaway i feel so disgusting right now it is my little sisters 18th and she decided to order chinese to celebrate i was at work all evening and honestly was hoping that by the time i got in they would have finished eating and have it all out away in the fridge i had my dinner planned out and this whole week has honestly been perfect ed wise i have hit my steps stayed under my step goal i have not been super hungry i have just eaten my safe foods and moved on anyway i get home and as i am undressing i hear a knock at the door it is the food arriving i should have just stayed in my room because i the second i came down and smelt it all i just had to have a plate my family all know about my ed so they were encouraging me to have some too now it feel disgusting it really want worth it there was so much meat as well and i am basically a vegetarian at this point so it was just horrible i cannot purge so i have just got to sit with it and try not to tear my skin off i am so stupid and i hate myself my mental health is so bad right now and this really is not making anything better i am such a fucking failure and all i want is more food i really deserve the worst punishment,1,251
losing appetite because something someone kept you from getting food not quite sure how to explain this but this thing happens to me where i will go to the kitchen to get something i have been wanting to eat and see that it is gone and i will ask my sister and or family members and they will say that they ate it and then i completely lose the desire to eat and start feeling triggered and insecure like i can feel the fat on my body and just give up trying to eat something else not sure if i am the only one but it is almost like i feel like i do not deserve to eat anymore i do not know is it just me,1,127
does anyone else want to cancel therapy if they have gained weight or feel like they are failing at their ed i am not really in recovery right now and i am in therapy for other things as well but i do usually talk at least a bit about my ed because it is such a huge chunk of my life but when i am gaining weight or not losing weight aka i am in a b p phase of my ed i hate talking about it there is so much shame and disgust towards myself that the thought of telling them or even talking about my ed at all is painful because i just feel like pure failure and i cannot even describe it well honestly but there is so much shame i want help and i want to stop binging and purging but its so hard when my ed views restricting as good and b p as bad and it sucks because when i am b ping often my mental health is usually in a very bad place but i just cannot even talk about it,1,188
if you feel abnormally sad and tired you could be vitamin d deficient i had no idea i was deficient although i have not spent time outside for several months since it is so cold i took a multivitamin so i thought i was good but i have been so lethargic and unusually depressed the other day at my general checkup i got my blood drawn and somehow i still was deficient i was told to take a vitamin d supplement like magic i am feeling so much better and happier,1,91
reached my gw but reached my gw and so i thought i could stop obsessing about it once and for all finds out about bf and ends up finding something new to obsess about,1,34
i 21m feel completely fucked title pretty much sums it up i am lying in bed shivering feeling weak af and my bed is covered in my hair that is falling out like crazy i have arfid so bad to the point i currently weigh 105lbs at 6 0 tall which puts my bmi around 14 5 the scary thing is that i am getting help and my doctor done an urgent referral to the eating disorder people on the national health service last week they have given me an appointment to have an assessment with them on the 16th which is 8 days away but even then it will probably take weeks or months to get something done if anything apparently inpatient is not an option which pisses me off honestly i just want them to shove an ng tube down my throat now because i am barely able to stomach 1500 calories in december last year i dropped down to 102lbs and still have flashbacks to the suffering i went through then the hospital actually turned me away back then somehow managed to survive the last year i have already got osteoporosis in my spine and osteopenia in my left hip i just want the suffering to end it honestly feels like the help is not there so the only option after that is to die i really want to go to sleep and not wake up,1,239
thank you for being my safe space no one in my life knows about my ed and so it becomes overwhelming i love having this space to just vent about things that others will relate to and understand seriously thank you for being so kind and so helpful,1,48
no thoughts just reminiscing about my ed honeymoon phase i remember being 14 15 straight up fasting for days and low restricting for weeks and still being able to do daily chores and activities now i have relapsed again and this entire week i felt like i might just die at any moment despite high restricting makes me feel like garbage literally this is the only thing i have got control over in my life and i am still failing at it,1,82
peer pressure to eat just a random rant something that drives me insane is when people try to peer pressure you to overeat or eat junk even worse is after you say no you get told something like how a little bit will not kill you or an are you sure you do not do that kind of thing when an alcoholic tells you that they want to stay away from drinking why is it okay to do when it comes to food,1,83
i do not even want to be skinny anymore i just want to stop hating myself i do not even know what i look like or what i want to look like i tell myself that if i reach a certain number that will be when i am objectively allowed to stop hating my body but i want to stop hating myself now and i want to eat food i am so fucking hungry all of the time but i cannot seem to stop myself anyways anyone else relate,1,89
i have an advent calendar this year,1,7
has anyone else messed up their metabolism so bad that they gain weight even if they are undereating for the past 2 months i have been counting calories and restricting eating around 700 800 calories a day sometimes more sometimes less and usually i would have to eat less than that to actually lose but if i eat 800 or more i gain i remember there was a time i ate 2 apples which i did not count into my calories they were probably like 150 cals at most and i gained 0 6kg  and now too when i eat 100cals more than i usually do i gain a lot  like  why how,1,113
no because this is so humiliating laugh my ass off i could not bring myself to finish a candy cane i ate maybe a quarter of it and i was too scared to eat the rest the cal count was basically nonexistent too this is so tragic of me,1,49
i feel so ugly i do not want to be thick i do not care if some people think that it looks good i just want to be flat and skinny,1,31
there are safe foods what about safe exercises the stairs really help me just sweat it out and at least counter bloating 30 minutes on it and i feel better and healthier hopefully it has long term positive effects on my cardiovascular health,1,43
underweight for the first time in my life tw ugly ramblings purely about weight i am not bragging i just really have a lot on my mind my entire life i was at the high end of normal or slightly overweight always chubby until i developed my ed almost 2 years ago at age 20 which is pretty late i do not know i lost and gained and lost and gained but the last few months got really bad when i started purging and i lost a lot pretty quickly and today i woke up with an 18 4 bmi 5 5 and 110lbs i never imagined i would be underweight i know i am thin now people tell me but it still feels weird i feel like i am not allowed to say i am skinny because surely i am not that is not me i dreamed of being thin my whole life ed or not and now i am and i do not know how i thought i would feel but i feel blank but i will say people notice me more people compliment me a lot when they did not before guys at work express interest in me guys who never would have cared to ask for my number when i was chubby it is like i watched the number on the scale change people act differently towards me i look different my old clothes do not fit i wear very small sizes i noticeably take up less space all this and more but i do not believe it still and i thought i would absolutely feel small enough when i was officially uw i do not know why that was the magic number but it was but i am not going to stop am i when will it be enough god i am fucked up laughing out loud it is also messed up that this feels like such a big fucking deal when it is not that deep and i am just a big disordered baby lol there is also that i feel like a fraud too i am not a skinny person i am a fat person who threw up enough of their food to get to pretend to be skinny bleh,1,377
did anyone start their ed by accidentally losing weight i decided to go vegetarian a few years back with absolutely no desire to lose weight i just wanted to see if i could hack being a vegetarian i guess through not eating meat i lost a few pounds and people started pointing it out and complimenting me here is where my ed started i became obsessed with how i looked to others and wanted people to comment on my slimmer figure now here i am two years later laughing out loud,1,91
had a realization saw a video on my youtube recommended the other day where a competitive cheerleader had won a world championship then a few days later she fractured her neck in a freak accident and wound up quadriplegic made me have a bit of a reality check because i have had an ed for over 10 years and never once have i been grateful that my body keeps me alive and that i am fully functional although i deprive myself of food i am able to eat by myself although i abuse exercise i am able to run and move freely i am able to make conscious decisions to interact with others and to live life in reality my ed is a very small part of my life that feels very big sometimes because it is all i focus on and i am really missing out on the things i am so thankful for like time with my family even though it seems hard i encourage you to try and step outside of the ed headspace for even a moment today and count those many blessings i am not religious but it seems to be the best way i know how to explain it you all are beautiful individuals with kind hearts and you deserve to live a full and happy life this community has helped me through so much do something that makes you happy today and savor that moment gratitude is really helping me in recovery even though i am still using behaviors i am trying to be a little more thankful that my body let us me experience love and life every day we only get one let us make the most of it sending you all so much love today i have seen a lot of sad posts recently so i wanted to provide some positivity and encouragement,1,313
you all ready to hear some clown shit i fucked my ex who deadass does not have feelings for me and i felt like an idiot in the morning then i realized i did not eat yesterday and i was like woo hoo at least that is a win like bro both of those are losses what is wrong with me i feel like my life is written by the people who make riverdale,1,74
every therapist i saw that advocates for haes pushed me into relapse tw mention of calories i have only saw two but every one that does always pushes me into a relapse i hate it it throws me into a binge restrict cycle which makes me not even want to bring it up in therapy sometimes i do not even want to tell the therapist i have had have an eating disorder touch subject but i eat enough calories just under my maintenance level though having haes causes me to binge which later on causes me to restrict again i have left a voicemail to a few therapists about an eating disorder when i was asking for therapy and then some where i did not mention it i am honestly just considering seeing the ones where i did not mention my ed to get to the root because of my eating disorder instead of jumping right into haes stuff again i would rather eat slightly slightly below my maintenance level not under 1 100 1 200 calories of course i am 5 3 for reference and have a healthy relationship with food than jump right into maintenance level which will absolutely because me to binge due to guilt later on in the week month or because me to restrict later on that is just how the ed mind works sometimes i guess,1,232
does anyone else get so anxious about underestimating calories,1,9
why do i keep disappointing myself bruh why the fuck do i keep binging i know it always ends in me purging everything being in pain and restricting the next day it is literally so stupid i swear to god why cannot i just restrict i think i am literally going to have to bar myself from the dining halls at my school or some shit i do not know what to do i know i should probably give in to the extreme hunger or something but i am so scared to gain weight,1,94
i probably fucked up a romantic interest because of how my dumb brain works a girl i have been talking to got me a gift and stated last night that she would like to see me today i was feeling bloated and stressed and body looked like crap today so i decided to go to the gym did a lifting session followed by a ton of cardio so i could sweat it all out i finish my workout and text her and she says she assumed we were off because i got back so late and she was in her pjs her texts made it obvious she was hurt even if she did not say it outright she was so excited earlier in the day and i turned into that asshole guy i never wanted to be and because of fucking what i did not like how i looked in the mirror so i decided i need to punish myself and sweat like crazy at the gym fuck i am sorry if i hurt your feelings you did not deserve that i am trash fuck you ed too but obviously i cannot blame or pin it at that at the end of the day it is me,1,207
i just did the most disordered shit i have ever done i have theater the whole week so i have to leave much earlier my mom decided to save me leftovers from last night s dinner tacos but she always gives me way too much meat cheese and corn so this morning before everyone was up i took the leftovers out of the fridge and threw some of it into the garbage disposal then i got worried mom would notice so i did what any logical person would do and took some of the meat and corn out of the garbage disposal and put it back into the container and i ate it tonight,1,114
recoverinspo since i like to draw curvy bodies and use myself as a reference i need to gain weight to be able to do so,1,25
anyone else slowly just realising they will have this ed forever and even recovery will not get rid of the thoughts or urge to be disordered,1,26
what is the weirdest thing your ed has made you believe randomly just remembered the time i got gifted pyjamas 4 5 dress sizes bigger than what i wore literally double my size from a girl i worked with as part of kris kindle genuinely thought for the longest time that i had like backwards body dysmorphia and saw myself as way thinner than i was drove myself mad measuring myself all the time,1,74
i know i sounds so ungrateful but i wish people would not but me clothes my grandparents got me a top and they got it in a size that is bigger than what i would go for and it is really messed me up cuz even though it is like really oversized it is just it is like making me want to starve myself more cuz if people think i am that size then i do not know what i am saying anymore but i am just hella triggered from it i do not know why and like i am really not doing well at the moment at all and this was like the last thing i needed but of course they did not know so i cannot blame them,1,130
safe food everything i cook myself ok so i really enjoy cooking it is like therapy or something i take my phone put on a long amber video sip on a diet sody and cook sometimes for hours and the thing is even if i cook high calorie stuff like lasagna it is ok like i have put too much effort into it to not eat it i also cannot just cook my old weird ed meals because i live with my partner and i do not want to accidentally poison them i do not know sometimes it makes feel invalid i mean there are further rules even for stuff i cook myself like i cannot eat it before 6 in the evening and stuff but still premade food and takeout still scares me especially baked goods but yeah i do not know just wanted to say this i do not know if it is progress or if it invalidates me,1,161
my ed makes me paranoid x200b i feel like everyone is lying to me about how i look that they are all telling me i look fine to make eat and make me gain weight i feel like all my friends are backstabbing and they do not want me to be thinner than them i feel like my parents are secretly adding oil and butter to what i eat even though i know they would never do that i feel like the food packaging is lying to me because where is the proof they are not lying about the calories i feel like the scale is lying to me because how do i weigh xx pounds when i look like i weigh so much more i feel like my stomach is pretending to be hungry just because he is greedy and want more food this fucking sucks i am sick of over questioning every single thing in my life,1,159
i want to stop restricting but my mind is telling me i am just using an excuse to eat more than i should currently heavily restricting and i have been thinking i should try to eat at least my bmr s worth but i keep thinking do i need to or am i just trying to find an excuse to allow myself to eat more in a day when i do eat higher cals my mind does not let me rest i keep thinking i was weak and i did not need to eat all of that i do not know how to just let myself eat and not think of all these things it is so frustrating,1,118
merry christmas i wish everyone the freedom to enjoy the holidays thank you to everyone on this sub who has shared their fears their inspirations and their journeys big thanks to those who have gone to the trouble to reach out and give so much of themselves to offer support i really appreciate you all and i hope you have a magical celebration,1,63
dysmorphia with clothes anyone else pick up clothes and think there is no way they will fit but then they do and sometimes even be big on you i feel like i really have no idea what my body actually looks like or what size it is,1,47
i have remembered some reasons i wanted to recover 1 not feeling so sick after i eat an actual meal 2 being able to walk more and not ache and seize up 3 being more present when with people 4 my moods not being so low whenever i am alone 5 not having to piss all the time 6 less brain fog 7 being able to be productive for longer than five minutes 8 my heart beat being more regular 9 not having that feeling that even when i am laying down i am still using too much energy 10 being able to sleep 11 not being stuck in my brain with my thoughts all the time 12 not getting acid reflux every time i eat 13 being able to eat socially without visibly stressing 14 not feeling like dying when i am full or not hungry 15 not feeling like being sick all the time do you have any reasons to add these are the ones that stand out to me the most right now,1,176
anyone else s head constantly filled with numbers i am mostly recovered at this point but the calories percentages grams of protein are always tallied in my head i never downloaded any applications for it because that felt like accepting that i was sick but now i am stuck having memorised everything and when i am actively sick it gets so much worse i obsess over the numbers on clocks number of bites scheduling which cutlery i use the number on the volume dial it truly feels like i develop a form of ocd that is only partially expressed through eating habits it all just takes up so much of my mental space and it is exhausting,1,117
when people give unsolicited comments on your body in recovery when i started getting better and was putting weight back on in my early 20 s every single person who had not seen me for a while would comment on my appearance them oh you have gained weight i did not even recognize you you look healthy me triggered af screaming internally ha ha thanks it ended up with me hitting my breaking point sitting on a sidewalk at 3am drunk as hell having a full blown panic attack and sobbing at my concerned friends about how i am sooo fat now everybody thinks i am a failure i used to be the skinny one and now i am the fat failure who could not cut it nooo i did not end up relapsing but if i had those comments would have been the main trigger so if you are starting recovery tell everyone who knows you have an ed anyone you are comfortable telling  friends teachers parents family  to please keep the unsolicited comments about your body to themselves it is rude to do that to anyone first of all but you are already struggling you do not need that kind of trigger messing with your mind if they want the best for you as i am sure they do then they will respect that,1,226
i hate workplace christmas potlucks i bloody hate the holidays why cannot people just accept no thank you without making a big spectacle about it it always makes me feel so guilty and awkward when i am the only one not eating at a gathering it also makes me feel really ashamed when my manager pipes up with she does not eat breakfast or lunch all she has is coffee i was the only one still wearing my mask too so i was able to hide my sad expression why do people feel the need to constantly push you to eat or bring attention to people who are not eating maybe i already ate maybe i have to be careful with the types of food i eat and do not know what ingredients were used maybe i am just not fucking hungry,1,142
binged horribly for a week from sunday to friday i binged like crazy i ate and ate to the point where drinking hurt and woke up ravenously hungry the next morning after snapping back into my senses i ended up going over my weekly maintenance calories by 40 000 calories in just 6 days guess i gained 5kg this week i am the walking definition of insanity because i have eaten nothing yesterday or today and have been exercising for hours thinking this time will be different i am the whole circus,1,92
let us talk about mpa not in a way as to glamourise it because it obviously sucked but to not make it so taboo i feel like a lot of us were involved with it or ed twt or tumlr and i think we should discuss the dumpster fire that was this breeding grounds for terrible ed advice and stupid aspirations,1,61
twitter how do i stop lurking edtwt and shtwt i find myself deleting twitter for a few days and then re downloading it a few days later it is a constant pattern i do not understand why i am so obsessed with other peoples eating disorders or others self harm it is so stupid it is really triggering it is literally on me though cuz i am the one that keeps going back to it lol i do not know if i go on those communities to trigger myself or i genuinely like interacting with them but i just cannot get rid of twitter,1,104
dreading seeing people after wg quick vent i am dreading seeing my family over the holidays or rather having them see me i have gained some weight and now i am a healthy weight which i do not need to explain comes with its own baggage i mentally feel worse i am also going to be seeing some old coworkers at a party in a few weeks the last time they saw me i was not doing well but my eating disorder was thriving and i feel like they are just going to look at me and think i have no self control maybe even tell me i look better but i worry they actually mean i look disgusting and they are just being nice i hate thinking this way these are supposed to be people who actually care about me my rational brain is like why would these people who care about me even think that shit i know it is irrational but i cannot stop i would never think these things about another person or wish these feelings on anyone,1,182
i live everyday fearful of being featured in a chubbyemu video this is my tale of woe 23 year old woman presenting to sprout s farmers market for her weekly shopping trip the young woman suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder and had one particular safe food cottage cheese but she was not eating any cottage cheese she was consuming 16 oz of probiotic cottage cheese daily she had taken a particular liking to it after her previous safe cottage cheese was discontinued in her neck of the woods looking and side eyeing you friendship dairy 1 cottage cheese her bowels wrecked by the powerful probiotics she spends every waking moment in agony gripping her torso as her guts twist and turn inside her like an old model washing machine my toes curl and grip the floor for stability as i let out a massive flow of dookie soup 3 days 3 fucking days of this the end,1,157
you all i just sh t myself in my bfs car why is my body so terrible,1,17
i weigh less than whatever bs goal i had and i am too tired to feel anything about it i do not even want to go any further to be honest i do not even know if i am that much bothered i am just so tired everything aches i am weak and cold and cannot think straight i am incredibly anxious and the stupidest thing pushes me over the edge i feel like i am way past the point where i can even have enough energy to be happy about my ed goals,1,94
laugh my ass off i have started exercising because it keeps me from being constantly cold but i am cold because i am restricting but exercising increases my deficit so i am cold more so i have to exercise more and it is a cycle,1,45
pre period binges does anyone else have that one week out of the month where their stomach is a literal bottomless pit for like 4 days i noticed it is always before my period and it is like hard to stop because i keep feeling hungry i have just been eating a little bit of everything or like half of snacks and giving the rest to my son my appetite has been permanently shrunk from my ed in college but i am telling you during the pre period days it is like i am back to my high school appetite which is no bueno overeating anyway it is been a bit tough but i ended up buying a thing of toasted chocolate marshmallow oreos the supreme flavor of oreo and got a taquito from the fast station,1,137
it is hard to starve when you are happy i got back together with my boyfriend and i feel like my life is going how it should he is an amazing partner and i see a future with him i gained weight and yes there are moments where i hate myself but it is hard to not eat or force myself to run when i am not deeply unhappy but in fact the happiest i have been in years,1,79
fainting fantasies ever since the nosedive of my relationship with food in around april of this year i have been enamored with the idea of fainting in school in public i fainted once at home in the middle of the night after going down the stairs to get water thank god it was not on the stairs now that i think about it lol and i got sooo excited i did not tell anyone yet it still felt so good i wore it like a badge mentally finally i am sick i was counting down the days until a dizzy spell finally happened in front of my peers i still find myself coming back to the sick hope i will fall over in class during a presentation some days unfortunately but something struck me i have fainted in public before i got sick i grabbed a little snack bar situation in preparation for an event with my dad in my infinite folly i forgot to check the ingredients again before i developed ednos oh if only i forgot to check the back of foods now 3 it was a cashew bar i am allergic to cashews but an eighth of the thing was already in my stomach i ended up getting violently sick feeling better on the long car ride there only to break out in hives and nausea near the end of my wild night out i passed out trying to walk to the bathroom in front of a bunch of adults my dad s age poor guys literally had to drag me to another room in order to give me water one of the most embarrassing memories i have it was awful i felt like a fucking idiot all these people had completely stop what they were doing because i forgot to check that i was not allergic to my food i cannot believe my eating disorder made fainting seem so glamorous and elegant when it is   just   not   that way there is no real way to communicate how mortifying it is you wake up confused on the floor with your entire body aching it sounds awesome in theory but in reality it is a shitshow take your electrolytes get your vitamins if you need help just ask for it you do not need to collapse in front of others in order to prove you are unwell no well person lies about doing badly it is insane stay safe,1,411
you are latina so you cannot be skinny i fucking hate when people tell me that i should not bother trying to look like girls from thinspo because i am latinaaa so my dna will not make it possible stfu also you can be white or black and still be latina i hate that people think that latina typical pornhub latina section with massive ass and boobs,1,67
you all ever just know when someone else has an ed me and my fully recovered friend were talking about this last night last year i had a friend who said something once and i was like yeah she is disordered like a week later she told me she had an ed it is happened with a couple other people too we both suspect that one of our mutual friends has an ed and i hope we are wrong but i have been right every time so far,1,88
my anorexia is making me a horrible person and friend so it is christmas eve guess i am just venting i was supposed to go for lunch this afternoon with a friend and exchange gifts i have become so wrapped up in calories even more so around the holidays i just got so anxious leading up to it that i could not bring myself to go i ghosted him at the last minute he is obviously really upset with me i tried to apologize and make up another reason but it really did not cut it i do not know what to do anymore i obviously need to get help but it is so hard everyone around me is complimenting my weight loss and i feel so strong for the first time in my life i do not know guys i know i am awful but i just needed to tell someone,1,152
does anyone else love staying out all day does anyone else like to pack their schedule so they are too busy to come home and eat on weekdays i go from school to tutoring to work and get home past dinnertime so i can avoid eating dinner on weekends i occupy myself with schoolwork or go on long walks or trips it does not always work but at least this way i do not feel constantly tempted to eat out of boredom or binge at home anyone else relate,1,89
where is the line i want to recover i want to be a whole person again i want to be more than just skinny i want to make art and accomplish great things i am scared though so scared where is the line between anorexia and 600 pound life i have had an eating disorder for so long i do not know how to go back to normal my mental hunger is so intense that when i see what people eat on 600 pound life i think to myself i could definitely eat all of that too how can i ever recover then how can i be normal i have tried just restricting in a sustainable way like non disordered people do and i relapse every single time but some restriction is necessary right if we just ate everything we wanted then that is how people become 600 pounds and immobile right i honestly just do not understand,1,158
psa even overweight people need to be aware of low blood pressure please note i will not be sharing calorie numbers in this post there will just be talk of restriction about me i am overweight maybe even obese by bmi standards afraid to check because i know i will be triggered i had a doctor s appointment today for some health issues my doctor does not know i have had disordered eating habits bouncing from bingeing to heavy restriction weight highs and lows for the last decade why i am making this post i brought up my concern about my blood pressure on average it is around 100 65 sometimes top number is in the 90s and bottom number in the late 50s my doctor said that is pretty normal for girls my age 26 and would only be a problem if i start getting dizzy faint she said that i need to make sure i eat well and do not restrict too much so my blood pressure does not continue to drop she wants to make sure i do not start getting concerning symptoms i never mentioned dieting to her and i am visibly overweight and no i do not just mean a lil chubby so i was surprised to hear her say that in my experience the higher my bmi the more i restricted as if to punish myself now i am seeing there really are risks even to those of us with higher bmis i always thought of risks being associated with low normal or underweight people so to my friends also at a higher bmi please track your blood pressure and try to eat well even if it is hard some potentially scary symptoms do not only happen to the lower bmi folks obviously i want everyone to track their blood pressure and eat well too regardless of weight but this post is specifically for those of us not thinking we would not be at any risk due to our current weight edit typo,1,339
i am a total bitch when restricting my brain does not work right and everything bugs me i hate it any tips i just want to be normal but eating more is not an option i am exhausted of people having to tiptoe around me,1,45

gender dysphoria do you think sometimes eds and gender dysphoria are related because i have found out that whenever i go out and get gender envy all the time i either get the urge to purge or binge it is weird but it is one of my essential triggers and makes me unable to go outside or i just do not look around to avoid seeing bodies because it makes me realize mine will never be like that,1,78
do you guys give yourself cheat days for birthdays holidays tomorrow is my birthday i really want to be able to enjoy it but do not even know if that is realistic for me i feel as though i am too far gone i want to be able to go out to eat and get whatever i want i want to be able to have seconds on cake without guilt i want to be able to accept the treats that my friends like to give me i do not understand why i keep denying myself these little joys,1,98
never looking anorexic due to my exercise addiction ok so i just want to know if i am alone in this i am diagnosed with anorexia nervosa but i do not look like those classic bonespo type girls 90 of my time as sick i have been addicted to running and strength training which has resulted in giant thigh muscles etc which is kind of self defeating because i am one of those who want to look like bonespo type girls i feel like because of my exercising i will never be that classic anorexic frail petite looking girl with giant thigh gap and stick arms its crazy because my legs are my biggest insecurity and i want nothing more than a thigh gap at the same time the disordered stuff i do is working directly against that laughing out loud am i alone in this,1,146
perks of having a family history of eds grandma has a shit ton of safe food and our christmas dinner is safe food were all insane,1,26
is anyone else not scared of trying new foods i like going through the grocery store and buying new things to try yes i do have a long list of food rules but as long as i know the nutrition and ingredients then i love to try new things,1,49
i cannot do this anymore anorexia has taken over it robbed me of all my friends it killed my confidence and my happiness i have missed so many opportunities because of it and it is ruined my dreams and ambitions i do not see the end of it now it is the only thing i have left how could i hate it when it is the only thing i have left,1,71

how was ellen from ttb able to restrict so well if there is one thing that bothered me about this movie besides the annoying british guy was the fact that ellen damn near had some superhuman ability to restrict herself from eating we never see her binge she does not purge because that is not her style or her thing or whatever she said in the movie she does not have any cravings at all we do not even see her eat any safe foods or tiny portions the very few times we do see her eat she chews the food and spits it right back out or eats a spoonful of food and says she is done i know it is just a movie but how in the tf was she able to function so well for that long assuming that she was battling an for quite some time until she passes out near the end,1,157
i am so over this i am over caring about how i look and what i eat every second of the day i feel like i am being drained of all my personality to make room for how much i obsess over food and how i look and what clothes i can wear that will not make me want to kms i am so sick of this but i am probably not going to change anything,1,76
reddit recap had no mention of ed subs and there is no way that is not where i spent most of my reddit time this year i assume it is because they excluded subs of this sort but i was wondering if they excluded other mental illness based subs or like not safe for work subs,1,56
i am not okay at all and it hurts and i know most of us are not but i just feel the need to say it i am really not doing okay honestly i just want to start sobbing but i cannot its hard to think about how bad my ed has gotten anyways i love and care about all of you and i hope you guys get a break from your minds for even just for a little while today,1,81
does anyone else get really anxious when they hit a new lw how do you deal with it it feels like such a precarious place to be like i am one binge away from undoing everything i am afraid if the uncertainty afraid of how weak i feel afraid of how difficult it will be to sustain part of me that wants to be healthy wants to stop losing but another part of me keeps driving myself to keep pushing lower because i still feel so repulsed by my body it is so tiring swinging between the two not sure what to tag this as i do want to recover so i guess recovery support,1,115
afraid of wasting food has anybody else developed a fear of letting food go to waste i swear before i developed orthorexia i was the king of to go boxes now though i feel the need to eat everything on my plate even though i have got 1 plenty of pyrex and 2 a mom who will gladly eat anything i have been recovering for nearly four months and i still struggle with this,1,74

i feel like i am a better person when i am sick and by sick i mean eating less i feel like i am a lot nicer a lot more tolerant maybe its just because it makes me hate myself a little less i would not say i feel happier but i do feel like a ghost floating around and existing maybe i still feel like a bad dog but maybe it is less who knows lol,1,77
what do your omads look like my omads turn into little binges sometimes and it is frustrating as hell anyone have recs for omads that are lower cal but filling enough to curb a binge salad tons of raw veg are fine but like we know already 3,1,48
when people around you start talking about how little they are eating today during literature class for some reason my teacher and groupmates started talking about food for some reason i do not really remember what they were mainly talking about because i was spacing out but then one girl goes i do not eat much and our teacher replies with yeah i can see and she continues yeah i skip breakfast and go to classes the whole day and then come home and eat at 8pm and when the teacher told her that she might faint from all that she said that she had fainted once why do people feel the need to say stuff like that and this happened soo many times at school too it is just i have not been to school in some time so i have avoided hearing my classmates very detailed remarks about how little they eat and how cool and special they are for being so so quirky ugh and also how do regular people faint when they eat little yet i do not faint when i go x days fasting literally how it feels like a curse that is supposed to make me feel fake and invalid and competitive because well i do not faint guess i am fine,1,218
i am wearing my fear pants not sure if other people have fear pants but there is this pair of pants that i really love but associate strongly with my ed i bought them when i was at my heaviest weight before my ed and they were the only pants that fit me i associate them now with being at that weight that i felt really heavy over the course of my ed the pants got super loose and i liked the way they looked even better but they had to be belted or they would fall off i have not tried to put them on in probs a year because i have been terrified of how they would fit me and how it would trigger me i put them on tonight though because they were the only thing i could find that matched and they are snug do not need a belt and i actually feel fine about this i took a big step putting them on today and i am proud of myself i love my self my body no matter how it is shape changes these pants are the cutest,1,193
is this normal i know it is not technically normal but is this normal in ed world after restricting for so long is it normal for hunger to just go away yesterday i was starving non stop and now today i have barely been hungry at all i have eaten but normally by now i would be starving i am not at all,1,63
my therapist spent the entire session arguing about nutrition and on telling me she is not a nutritionist i should have stopped her but my brain gets stuck when i am like this i have been really really struggling and i pushed myself to cycle 10km so i could see her even though i have barely been able to shower without feeling like i am going to pass out what i should have said is that i did not come there to talk about nutrition that i do not need a therapist to tell me that actually there is trustworthy evidence about what types of diets because high cholesterol or to insist that my body could probably adjust to eating healthier food i eat a fair amount of junk food when i am not restricting to get enough calories if i just keep at it what i need is someone to challenge me on why i am so scared of diet related health problems if it is a reasonable fear if it is just an excuse not to recover if worrying about it is worth the tradeoff for my mental health or if i would be better off eating unrestricted even if it falls outside of the recommendation of a healthy diet i do not need to be told that maybe i should go see a nutritionist so i can find out how much saturated fat i should have in a day i need to talk about why i cannot cope with conflicting information about food why seeing a nutritionist scares me because i feel like it will only make me more rigid in my thinking and will only give me more rules to fail at i need to talk about why i cannot cope with being told i am doing something wrong in terms of diet partially because i have spent my entire life being gaslit and or blamed for gastrointestinal issues partially because i grew up in a low income household partially because i am terrified of people thinking i am stupid partially for reasons i have probably yet to discover but instead of diving into that i got an hour long back and forth about fat and carbohydrates and about how it is all location based anyway because asian people are lactose intolerant thank you very much,1,390
the masculine urge to just sit in bed for weeks on end without eating or getting up and withering away to dust,1,22
i do not like sustaining my body because it is tedious repetitive i do not like the burden of having to eat every single day i do not see a point in living and despise having to sustain myself in anyway i do not know why i have to destroy plants and animals just to sustain myself it is not about being thin at all i would like to be a body builder if anything i want to be dead and do not want to eat because it sustains the life i hate i hate the feeling of masticating food i hate knowing i have to nourish my body i hate shitting pooping is a huge joke it is a waste of time i also hate sex because i feel like it is my body tricking me into reproducing,1,139
no thoughts head empty like literally any interests gone any creativity gone any intellect and intelligence gone any personality gone everything revolves around food i wake up and it is food i plan my entire day after food i just know how i get dumber and more stupid with each day and after i existed through my day i go to sleep just to dream about food i cannot remember anything from the past few days i just know that i wrote two of my pre finals which i could not study for because i was too busy distracting myself by mindless entertainment if i remember anything then only my meals steps and b ps i am not able to do any homework and after such hard work of getting decent grades again i fail almost every subject i am getting insane i isolate myself more and more and the worst thing is while i fail at life i feel like i fail at my eating disorder as well i just cannot keep up with my goals i am kind of grateful for meeting my boyfriend regularly and joining orchestra class but i skip school again and only thing i think about is how many calories i might burn while playing the instruments or kissing him i hope the flair was accurate and that my vent is not too problematic i just do not know where to vent anymore i am just a burden to everyone i apologize a lot if a vent like this is not welcomed,1,258
disordered eating eating disorder i feel like people are blurring the lines between an eating disorder and disordered eating i think it is very important to be aware of disordered eating but skipping meals counting calories and so on does not inherently mean someone has an eating disorder i do not know i will never go and tell someone they are invalid or whatever but sometimes it kills me seeing what people consider disordered i feel like it pushes people from getting help because of shit like everyone has had an eating disorder which is simply not true i do not know i am just frustrated with how loosely words are being thrown around at this point and someone who dieted for a few weeks is now labeled as someone who is had an eating disorder i just wanted to hear the thoughts of other people on this also for your information i think its still important to challenge disordered eating because it can develop into other shit and it is still 100 draining but an eating disorder is significantly different,1,181
how to forgive myself after binge eating hello 17m here and i am starting my recovery for bulimia and that seems to be going well so far however the one thing i cannot get under control is my binge eating it is 12 in the afternoon and i have eaten avocado toast in an attempt to eat more healthy then i had some cashews then i had some flaming hot popcorn and then a cupcake and then i finished a whole bowl of leftover pesto pasta one reason i absolutely hate my binge eating disorder is that it ruins the whole day i feel like sh t afterwards because i have failed to commit to eating more mindfully i get discouraged from exercising for that day because welp it is not like i will be able to burn off all those calories and i just feel so fat afterwards i just get so discouraged does anyone have any tips it would be much appreciated,1,164
cookies i did not let myself eat cookies for so long that now i need to eat alllll the cookies like one of each kind and one from each batch and if this one was not that good then i need another one and if this one looks softer then i have to eat that one too to experience all the good cookie softness that i never let myself have as if it will go away and i will never be able to eat them ever again and i have to get all the yummy goodness that i never let myself have,1,102
no one cares about me now that i am not sick anymore and it fucking sucks my family only cared about me when i was underweight and my body was in a scary zone if i was still underweight my mum would not be buying me laxatives every week or allowing me to fast for the amount of time i do they do not care i was so much happier with my old body and when i was sick why do they think i am happier i am probably in the most horrible mental state i have ever been because of my body and everything but i am weight restored i am eating my heart and bp is good so i am happy and better now right they do not see what happens behind closed doors,1,136
how do you study for college with your disorder it is finals week and my ed is making it a bitch to study i cannot focus when i am hungry and cannot stand having to sit and study want to be up and moving does any one have tricks to making studying and work easier,1,55
any motivation i have to recover is immediately destroyed by people telling me how unhappy they are after gaining weight ok this is a rant but at work people are constantly telling me that they have gained weight during the pandemic and saying they need to eat salads go to the gym more buy more baggy clothing blah blah blah it is neverending i feel like i was doing a decent job at recovery but am now absolutely terrified to gain weight because my coworkers seem totally miserable i am in this weird place where my health got really bad due to anorexia and i went to treatment this was before i got this job and have been trying to weight restore and view all foods as neutral but damn like it is miserable here and i know that losing more weight is dangerous but they seem just as miserable if not more their annoying comments about how they are jealous of my body fuel this further also i realize i could say something to them but my ed is like no listen to how miserable they are remember that and it is like dude i do not know how is anyone supposed to recover when this is socially rewarded it is like hard to go against it too because it is like they are all bonding with each other over weight i also do not want to get too personal with them and have them scrutinizing what i eat etcetera rant over,1,253
nsfw has anyone else experienced this with 2 ok guys i am hoping for advice because i do not know what to do  every time i poop lately there is blood or red urine i have not even been restricting that much i do not know what is going on it is definitely not my period and it is not like it even hurts to poop or anything has anyone else had this,1,73

anyone else have to argue with their mind about their calorie limit dailyyyyy is it too much to ask for for my mind to be on my side what the fuck basically i am at the point again where my cal limit feels too high again its not i am literally staying under it but i am starting to feel guilty and its a constant argument with myself trying to remind myself that if i restrict too much i will binge buttttt no my mind still wants me to feel like shit for eating an already too low amount of calories this is exhausting i am here arguing with my self like noooo what do you mean brain i love that slightly higher number its so pretty no need to go lower,1,132
is it extreme hunger trying to recover from restrictive anorexia and i am currently eating so so much i know about extreme hunger but i am barely hungry yet i am constantly snacking because mentally i just want to eat everything i am uncomfortably full most of the time but i keep eating eventually i reach a point where it is too much and i am able to focus on other stuff but most of my day is consumed by consuming food lol is it normal i guess i just need some reassurance,1,93
the fuel of fasting diet subs applauding dramatic weight loss i was on one of these subs today saw some before after pictures of someone who is now v petite eats 2 very small meals day according to her comments i am not trying to diagnose an ed by any means but applauding such dramatic weight loss feels like it encourages even more weight loss if she is completely healthy good for her but i always worry that those posts are fuel for an ed sufferer anyone else feel worry this way,1,92
note about the eyes on your own plate principle do not take it too far especially if you are not actively doing recovery    it can be really helpful to model eating behavior off of non disordered people if you fall too deep into the i am doing what is best for me i have an ed they do not i have different needs thing it can just entrench ed tendencies and also make you oblivious to when what you are doing is really abnormal sincerely a girl who did that thing,1,91

why am i so embarrassed by being overweight i am 100 convinced that when i lose 40lbs i will be so much happier being overweight is stopping me from going out my house etc when i was 25lbs lighter i had so much more confidence and shit i do not know just ranting i think to myself that the only thing stopping me from being happy is me shoveling foods to my mouth and how easy it is to just stop if i put my mind to it,1,88
in the end it was all for nothing this is so stupid but i have basically been low restricting since november so that i would be able to fit into my way too small sparkly dress on nye and now my friends are saying that they would rather just stay home and play board games and i am i do online uni i just want to go out one night and dress up and put on some makeup and a pretty dress and now i straight up want to cry like you are telling me i have been absolutely miserable for two months for nothing now i just want to not eat until nye anyway i do not know why my brain just says it will make me feel better i obviously have several assignments due so i cannot i should not unless i feel like this is my ed s fault too like i am stuck with a 19 year old s brain and i want to party and get trashed all the time while everyone my age is just over it or maybe i am simply a hopeless party girl at heart i do not fucking know yes i am aware of how absolutely ridiculous this all sounds eds are not rational at all apparently,1,217
the women on selling sunset recently enjoyed watching this show because of the houses and fashion i would bet most of these women have an ed as someone who was near death from anorexia some moments i have noticed when they were at the cafe and someone asked if they should get dessert too christine gasps and looks shocked then jokingly says but you are already a snack i am okay a regular person is not going to make a big deal out of such a simple food question like that davina tells christine to eat at the restaurant and she says no way i just put my lip ointment on k you got ready to go to this restaurant and just suddenly had to put your lip ointment on heather i have low blood sugar i do not get hungry also heather i will have water for lunch thanks i have not watched the season with emma yet,1,159
does anyone else feel anxious if they cannot weigh themselves so my mom took my scales away because she thought i was being obsessive and i could have them once a week i am still sticking to my relatively low restriction but still in the back of my mind my anxiety is wondering what if i am not losing weight what if i am still the same weight as last week even though i am eating at a restriction that should be x pounds per week kind of sad that my life currently revolves around watching the scales go down but my life is on pause until i reach my first gw,1,112

weighing my foster kitties to make sure they are on track and being jealous they are under 2 pounds this is so dumb,1,23
does anyone else have periods of regular eating like sometimes i can eat normal and have no bad thoughts at all without even really trying to recover and these can last months sometimes it feels invalidating so i was wondering if anyone does something similar,1,45
recovery win i do not look anorexic anymore exactly as the title says i have still got about 7kg to go before i am fully weight restored but i do not look so obviously sick anymore one of the hardest things about being at my lowest was that i could not hide my battle with this illness i felt so exposed knowing that my body was giving everyone a window to my mental fragility i would keep my eyes on the ground because i hated that moment where i would notice them noticing my condition it is hard knowing that everyone can see what you are thinking i used to believe that anorexia would help me to disappear that it would afford me anonymity but it did not it just broadcast my private battle and self hate to the world making me feel even more vulnerable but i feel like now that my battle is not so visible i can feel more comfortable trying to go out more and i can start working on building my confidence i did not realise just how much i had avoided going out because of the stress of having people knowing so much about me just by looking at me,1,206
relapsing do not want to lie do not wan t to get lectured by my therapist just a vent really i have taken a turn down a relapse path and i have no energy or desire to turn it around right now i am at an uncomfortable weight and want to take some of it off i do not want to lie about it in therapy but when i am honest she spends the whole session trying to rationalize with my ed it feels like lecturing and it is not that i do not know all the stuff she is saying i just really do not care right now i have other stuff i want to work on trauma i am in my 30 s so this is a long standing pattern i know she is right even i just do not care,1,143

i want to recover but i do not want to gain weight i am honestly pretty happy with my weight right now i am pretty skinny fat and can barely move but i am not underweight i am willing to eat more but i am worried i am going to gain all my old weight back my ed has taken over my life and i want to be happy again but i do not want to go back to my life before my ed either every article i read says i am going to gain all possibly more of my weight back and its stopping me from recovering is this true if i start eating more will all my weight come back i feel like it might be the only thing standing between me and recovery thoughts,1,137
i lost the weight but it all came from my ass fuck,1,12
has anyone ever thought of shaving their head because of hair loss i have and always had quite long hair and suffer from hair loss due to under eating i think my hair loss is only visible for people who have seen me and my hair before the start of my hair loss but i guess it is just a matter of time until it is also visible for everyone my malnutrition has also influenced my scalp in general at least that is the only way i can explain the increased greasiness and other less pleasing things going on on my head lol both these things sometimes lead me to thinking i should shave my head completely now my questions are does anybody else think that way sometimes and has anyone ever done this before because of similar or same reasons,1,141
clothes goal backfired so i have always had a sort of goal of fitting into tiny clothes and looking glamorous well now i am so skinny that nothing fits and everything looks shapeless and i am so cold all the time that i just wear a ton of layers so yeah this disease is so much fun maybe this is what i need to kick my butt into recovery,1,69

ok i am going to do it my new years resolution is to do the healthy life there is a gym in my condo building i live alone and buy my own grocery and i will start a more stable and high paying job in january so that also helps not freak out and get depressed over money and bills etc i am going to actually try and begin having a healthy lifestyle i also will need to adjust my antidepressants i think i need a higher dose for now to help me get through this i will fucking do this or at least give my best fucking shot not going to take any shitty fitness influencers advice and research and talk to professionals about diet and whatever i am scared but also excited at the idea of looking and feeling normal maybe even feeling better i am so physically and emotionally miserable i just cannot fucking do this anymore,1,160
do you guys also weigh yourself after insert anything here me weighing myself after shaving my arms literally what am i doing,1,22
do comments made about your body send you into an episodic relapse i will share my experience when someone makes a comment about my body like for example oh you are getting chubby or see your cheeks coming out it completely triggers me i do not know how to receive the information and it makes my self perception worse it is worse when i would immediately start seeing myself as fat and start feeling disgusted in myself i do not know how to control the situation it happened recently and i was able to tell the person i do not like comments being made on my body and they apologised so it is all good well it should be but i am struggling to not start restricting hard i have been going back and forth between recovery and relapse i am allowing myself eat more but now i am literally fighting with myself to not starve i am sorry for my incoherent thoughts,1,163
why is my thighs touching the worst thing in the world ruins me more than anything i am so close to relapsing because my thighs touch too much,1,28
ed moms does anyone else fee like their mom caused their ed and that they currently have one too today my mom told me she was concerned because i eat a lot of vegetables and i am not getting in my calories then i asked her what she ate today and she freaked out at me she only had coconut water and an orange and when i called her out for being hypocritical she said i did not know what i was talking about like hello,1,86
does anyone else use sex as a way of validation edit not safe for work warning i guess i am dumb got really drunk yesterday and had sex with a guy i was not attracted to at all only because it temporarily raises my self esteem and makes me feel hot because someone is interested i guess it is also because i am a people pleaser and cannot say no i do it because the other person has a good time now i am left hating myself even more than yesterday i feel gross and confused because i am not even romantically attracted to men could this be something ed related,1,111
laughing out loud my boyfriend of 3 years cheated on me with a man and probably gave me an sti trigger warning sexual assault my bf who previously identified as straight met up with a rando off this fucking application to experiment with men for the first time while it does not bother me that he wanted to explore i always thought we were sex positive enough to talk about it before he had that experience and at the very least that he would do so safely and tell me afterwards well apparently this happened a couple months ago and he had been having uti symptoms did not tell me and then we had sex now i have symptoms and i also got fucking cheated on we had not been intimate much lately since mu sex drive has been pretty low due to restriction and depression we had a two month dry spell that he is now saying was one of the reasons he did it maybe i am a prude but that is not that long bro like wtf the worst part is the guy was some creep and was not the most understanding to my bf being new to experimenting with men i think he made him very uncomfortable and i feel hurt and betrayed but i am also really upset that someone violated him he said they did not go all the way but that he was a little aggressive and did not listen when he said he did not like something i want to be there for my partner as someone who cares about him but i do not think i can put my own hurt aside right now everything is fucked and in response i simultaneously want to eat everything and yet nothing at all i wish i ate less today actually i wish i was not trying to stop smoking nicotine i wish i did not work tomorrow i wish i could make my whole life just disappear if i could start over i would i would change so much anyways that is my story end rant,1,353
i tried to take my own life i know this is definitely not the sub for this kind of post i can take it down if it is not appropriate living with an ed became too overwhelming and i tried to take my own life thing is i do not even remember it i apparently took a whole bottle of sleeping pills and downed it with an entire litre bottle of vodka how i survived no idea but i do not remember doing it i was hospitalized for a few days and i guess my way of coping is to tell people what is going on i am not really someone who is closed off which is probably why the ed became too overwhelming i never told anyone and still have not anyway i have a spam instagram account with about 20 people on it and i shared what happened i live in a different country from all my friends since i just moved to study abroad and i wanted to share this big thing i woke up to not even remembering i guess i talked about it too much and now everyone is annoyed with me and saying i did it for attention it was just a lot to process because i am suddenly in the hospital failing organs cannot walk and fucked up vision completely alone 4000 miles away from my family and friends because of something i do not even remember doing i was overwhelmed i do not know what the point of this is i just feel even more alone than before i almost consider you guys as better friends than my in real life friends so i guess i am seeking comfort,1,287
this shit makes me never want to stop restricting for context i was overweight my entire life and ended up with a bmi of 39 5 by the time i was 19 then i started heavily restricting last year and lost around 100lbs i was reading an article on the psychological effects of major weight loss and there was a part that said body image post weight loss is often quite complicated perhaps that helps explain why the rate of recidivism among people who have lost significant amounts of weight is shockingly high by some estimates more than 90 percent of people who lose a lot of weight will gain it back because if that is true then why the fuck would i let my guard down for a single second and risk gaining all that weight back it is literally my worst fucking nightmare and i will starve myself to death in order to avoid it and hearing things like that remind me that i can never allow myself to feel safe around food again edit lmaoooo the very next sentence said for another someone who is lost 100 pounds to get to 140 pounds will need to work harder including eating much less each day to maintain that weight than someone who is been at it her entire life and i am literally 136lbs and i have lost 100lbs ahhhhhhhhhhhhh what the fuckkk,1,235
i would love to do the tiktok photo dump trend but my whole camera roll is body checks and pictures of my cats,1,23
is it possible too still have an ed if things like this happen for instance when i am deep in my ed ill engage intensely in many behaviours thoughts and there is a devastating emotional impact but then depending on circumstance seemingly within days of eachother ill sometimes eat things id previously find too stressful to and eat alot or a normal amount and not be too bothered or engage in compensatory behaviours or purging sometimes feeling full will make me cry and sometimes i do not really care or ill know i will have eaten over maintenance consistently for a few days or kind of binged but tell myself ill wait till i feel the need to restrict and loose it all then literally within days of eachother it feels like i constantly am switching between the mindset of deep in my ed too a almost healthy normal brain and eating the thoughts r still there just quieter and i do not act on them as much do not have the energy or just do not care enough to be honest the normal eating with little guilt not because it was safe foods or id compensated just genuinley alright with eating it only lasts from about maybe a meal sometimes a day or at most a week but the thoughts are alot more present when its longer eating normally its like either way ill always creep back too engaging in my ed and restriction trying too make it worse than last time but if i really had an ed why is it sometimes so easy too flip back and forth between these eating and thought patterns i do not choose too i am sure but its so frustrating i am not ready too recover or eat feel normal for good but i also feel i cannot consistently restrict and its so frustrating i cannot restrict like i used too and miss how i looked but also want to enjoy food when i am able too because the moments when i feel ok and alright r fleeting its like i can never engage long enough in any behaviour too be considered a pure ed in my head binge restrict cycles pure restriction over exercising purging i am just constantly going between them all and i hate it i do not know just feel so invalid and fake and undisciplined is this even an ed ugh,1,405
anyone else i do not know if i am just weird but when i restrict i am completely obsessed with food like i could just try and not think about it but i spend hours scrolling though pictures of high calorie foods and watching other people eat and even cooking to see and smell the food but not actually eat it does anyone else do this,1,66
what is something you wish people could understand about eds for example i wish my parents understood that developing my ed was so much more than i was stressed,1,29
shower thought we stay in terrible relationships to justify our eating disorders and how we deserve what we do to ourselves,1,21
i do not eat at my new job and my coworker asked me if it was because i do not like them so i recently started a new job 3 weeks ago it is my first time working in an office so when we have our lunch break an office party they buy us food i do not eat there is already been two incidents where i did not eat when we were all in the room directly celebrating something this morning being the last time and i hate it they do not allow you to stay in your office everyone has to go in the lunchroom so of course i stick out we are all from the same culture so food is very important and is a group thing but it is honestly exhausting having to answer why are not you eating you are not hungry like almost every other day and from different people i take my lunch in my office but my office mate knows i do not eat lunch i just take my break she is the one that asked me if i do not like anyone and if it was a personal thing against her and the other people in the office and i just think it is bizarre i am very quiet anxious and shy so i know i come off as standoffish even though i try my hardest not to but it is such a weird thing to assume in my opinion like she did not even ask if i was okay if i was weird with food or had an ed just flat out assumed i was not eating to distance myself from other people in the office despite me literally feeling bad awkward and triggered that i am the only one who is not eating and my anxiety being so terrible because i am scared about what people are assuming about me like i just do not eat lunch it is really not a big deal or a because of concern to have the same conversation multiple times a week  and i prefer to eat at home and once a day my supervisor came into my office and gave me carrot cake and i ate some and i have honestly been beating myself up about it so badly as i am getting food with my bf later i work in the field of psychology too get me off this ride laughing out loud,1,412
i am going to try my best tomorrow i may be at my worst mentally right now but i am making a promise to myself that i am going to enjoy the coffee i get tomorrow and at least try not to let that little voice make me feel awful about it,1,52
does anyone else live just on protein like the title says i get most of my 800cal   day from protein so i might have some low cal baking for breakfast made with oat fiber and egg whites a protein bar for lunch and for dinner a chicken breast low fat soy milk coffee during the day i seem to be slowly losing maintaining along with my 1hr rowing per day on alternate days where on the other days i do 30min pilates what is going on protein is meant to have a thermogenic effect which takes 30 of the energy you consume through protein just to get the energy content out of the protein you are eating hence technically less calories taken in than stored consumed anyone else how do you lose weight on 800cal day you would think activity and low intake weight loss,1,145
took the cleanest biggest of the century thank you santa,1,10
today has been rough sooo my family always watches movies on christmas after opening presents well my dad could hardly enjoy it because he was so antsy to get to the gym and my mom compulsively walks every day and barely eats and she made a comment about how she needs to go for walks literally every single day it is freezing cold here right now and she still goes every single day and as someone who has not stopped thinking about their weight food intake and exercise for years it is extremely triggering i told my mom that if she does not feel like going then she should not and i asked her to be more careful with what she says in front of me due to my relationship with my body and she got really defensive and was like sometimes people just have to do things they do not want to do it is important to have a healthy lifestyle she does not understand that for people like me it is incredibly triggering to work out every day and eat super healthy i am weight restored but the ed thoughts are still always there and i just do not know how to cope anymore for me at this point in my life it is healthier to not work out every day because whenever i start my mind gets so obsessed with it that i cannot enjoy anything in life if i am not working out how i feel like i should be and it is super triggering to my ed thoughts news flash health is not just about your physical body when i almost started crying my mom suddenly got all fake sympathetic and was like awww why do you have a bad relationship with your body oh i do not know maybe because you constantly make comments about your weight or about how gross you looked at my weight or maybe it is because you associate skinny with pretty or maybe because i was literally underweight as a kid because i was such a picky eater and i internalized all of the aww you are so petite and cute comments or maybe the millions of other comments you and others have made about bodies and food and exercise throughout my life i am not even skinny anymore because i tried to recover and for a little while it went okay but my mindset is just getting worse and worse but i do not have the energy to restrict anymore so i feel like i am in this weird phase of being at a healthy weight but still having ed thoughts constantly fuck i am just tired i want to cry and hide in my room and never leave just a rant thanks for reading,1,467
how much of an influence if any has diet culture had on your ed for me it is one of the things that started it i started looking up a ton of stuff on how to lose belly fat and eventually that led to me getting orthorexia and i cut out a lot of foods i used to like,1,59
psychedelics and body dysmorphia anyone ever find that psychedelics can kind of temporarily hold your disordered eating off the first time i did lsd it wiped out my body image issues while i was tripping saw my body exactly as it was did not see that exaggerated pooch in my belly or thighs   like my body just looked normal and i could actually love it for a short amount of time obviously not a permanent solution since that only lasted for a few weeks or so but man was it a powerful moment of clarity,1,95
are you ever not scared of your ed because you are over weight by bmi standards i do not know what to do logically i do not think i have a drastic amount of body fat anymore because of how much i lift but i cannot help but think i am still fat i just keep thinking that i will only keep restricting until i hit a healthy bmi sometimes i think being overweight is worse than the restricting,1,79
my partner likes me skinni i am trying to recover i just sent him a photo and recognised the ribs lack of boobs sternum and commented that it was gross he said he thought it was hot and he would said a few words on the subject before i am he is mentioned in the past that he likes me small then vehemently took it back he is a massive supporter of me eating and me keeping it down he just wants me to be happy and he knows that is when i eat what i want and my weight goes up he fell in love with me 15kg heavier than now but i know his preference is this or less just a vent i guess i want to give him a hat he wants i know he will love me either way i do not know,1,147
it is my birthday it is my 18th birthday today and i decided ykw fuck this shit i am recovering spent way too much time with this crap ruined relationships missed so many opportunities i hope i make it i am really scared but i know it is something i have to do,1,53

can you recover from anorexia while pregnant hi i am 18 and pregnant for the very first time i am struggling with anorexia while pregnant and i am very scared i have had a very long think about it and i want to keep the baby i have not told anyone yet it is very embarrassing for me to say i am pregnant when i have a eating disorder at the same time is it possible to recover from my anorexia during pregnancy i need lots of support and advice here,1,91
how do people eat so little just out of hunger cues or forgetting too eat fml so frustrated my brother can basically go all day eating nothing and not even care think about food i am so jealous i feel good when i do the same and thwn am reminded of how much mental restriction i had too have too do that and how sometimes difficult i found it when casually he mentions how little hes ate not in a competitive way of anytbubg hes not aware as far as i now of my ed just a common teenage thing ig but like howwww does he eat basically nothing daily amp find it so easy like he does not even realise its 8pm and he should probs eat something and then of course he eats what he wants i feel so stupid and fake and invalid and weak that i eat more than him when i am trying too restrict fml i wish i was the forgets too eat never feels hungry never thinks about food ana but i am the complete opposite and its torturous edit i know i knowwww the whole forgetting too eat ideal is a romanticisation and stupid i just found it a kind of amusing contrast because i know the reality is complete opposite my point is i am annoyed at how little he can think about food amp how much i think about about it when we both eat similar amounts,1,247
friend who constantly brags about tiny appetite but is not underweight does anyone else have a friend like this who every time they eat just has to mention how they get full so quickly because their stomach has shrunk soo much this is my best friend who literally knows i have a fucked relationship with food and hate talking about anything to do with it but she is just so obsessed with telling me how small her appetite is she has adhd and says it is because of that but she is not even medicated so i do not know what the fuck she is going on about and as someone with bulimia it really fucking triggers me because my appetite is not like that at all i think what pisses me off about it is that she has a healthy bmi if not slightly overweight so i do not understand why she says this when it is clearly not true she is eating enough i feel like she does it to trigger me and make me feel bad for having a fucking appetite sometimes i fucking hate it and i feel like shit around her,1,196
dieting is so commonplace and i worry for fellow teenagers this is not exactly ed related but like it is ed adjacent and i have an ed so i am calling the shots was looking up meal plans for teens just now i thought a set meal plan uploaded for people my demographic might be a good thing to reference because i generally do not know how to eat normally all of them are straight up banana bonkers not only were maybe a quarter explicitly for weight loss i could not find a single one that had regular dairy products instead of low no fat i seldom saw whole eggs but egg whites wtf one had penne pasta as a cheat meal where are young girls supposed to get their fats without egg yolks or whole milk how are we supposed to grow with 6 slices of apple as a healthy snack i feel insane is this not crazy as an example of a particularly egregious one 3 4 cup of whole grain cereal with soy milk 1 2 cup banana berries 1 2 cup orange juice vegetable or fruit salad light dressing egg chicken if desired 1 2 cup vegetables 1 2 cup pork chop 1 4 cup mashed potatoes 1 cup soy milk only snack is 1 2 cup ice cream with no toppings might be ok for an elderly sedentary woman but for a teenager who could very well be doing athletics in school ahh x200b,1,249

i want to relapse so bad because the comfort of feeling sick and significant is so tempting i hate being home from college because i start to eat more and i weighed myself and i was actually happy with my weight because i lost weight but i know being home will make me gain weight and i do not want to gain weight and i am thankful for my therapist and she is really good but sometimes like right now i wish i did not have her so i could relapse without any hesitation i just want to make brownies and throw them up right now and i want to make sure i keep losing weight but i know it will not happen not while i am home because i lose all control when i am home and just eat but i do not want to anymore i wish i could stop and starve myself and not gain weight,1,159
this year for christmas i am just asking for the ability to poop,1,13
what do you do when you feel yourself relapsing i started anti depressants almost 2 months ago and finally thought i had made real progress on my relationship with food but i got triggered and now i can feel everything coming back please help,1,44
do you rapidly cycle between ed behaviors or do you tend to stick to one i have never actually been diagnosed so i do not know how a dr would classify me but i feel like i am constantly cycling through ed behaviors it will start with a couple of weeks of pretty much just restriction i b p once a week max sometimes not at all before i start to slip and have a lot of little mini binges after maybe a week of that my binges will get bigger and i will start start b p ing more and more frequently for a couple weeks until i am doing it multiple times a day by then i will usually reach a point of feeling so terrible that i pull myself together and start back at my restriction phase is this common for you guys or do you typically stick to behaviors from one ed,1,156
anyone else not like knowing exactly how much they eat i do not know knowing a exact exact number just makes me antsy it also makes me feel invalidated because i feel like a lot of people really care about numbers,1,41
yo any other guys here who have an ed i am not alone right i am 15 now but my ed started when i was 13 i hit a lw i cannot say it here but i will give a hint max speed of an old chevy silverado i would weigh myself every day i came home from school and i loved the feeling i got i use my ed as a coping mechanism and i identify with it strongly,1,80
baby steps i have loved coffee for as long as i can remember and for years i restricted myself i drank only black coffee as strong and dark roasted as possible i drank coffee instead of eating a meal my tolerance for caffeine became crazy high today i made myself a cup of coffee with oat milk i put two tablespoons of white sugar and i drank my frothy milky sweet coffee with a good breakfast i cried i cannot remember the last time i let myself enjoy a good cup of coffee,1,93
triggering roommates do any of you all have roommates that just do not fucking eat they literally subsist on tiny amounts of junk food like a happy meal or one chocolate bar a day i seriously do not understand them and no they do not have an ed they are just that weird type of person that has 0 appetite for some reason i love them but god it is triggering asf and it makes me feel like i cannot eat,1,81
had a positive ed breakthrough preface trigger warning numbers measurements i have always been a tall girl 5 9 5 i have a strong athletic build i have the type of body where i look like i am lighter than i am the best comparison i can think of is donna from that 70s show for my body type a huge ed trigger i have always had is looking at models that are all sub 130 pounds and feeling really fat and gross in comparison but i have recently accepted that i should not go below 140 pounds with my height and build that i am not unworthy of love kindness and respect if i weigh more than a supermodel that we are all built differently for the longest time 130 was my goal weight the holy grail of me deserving respect and love but i am making a choice to love myself enough to abandon that goal and try to recover for my own mental health,1,167
our disorders are different why is our treatment the same so in the past 6 months i have relapsed into my ed behavior or i guess my restriction purging behavior as for years i was struggling with overeating this has brought back a lot of memories of when i was last deep in my ed and in a treatment facility i was the only woman there who was overweight and i mean objectively and medically and one of the few that was there for bulimia the whole experience was horrible for me the differences between anorexia and bulimia not only in disorder but also thought patterns behaviors etc were so vast to me that it was detrimental to be receiving the same treatment of course there was no one there just receiving treatment for bed go figure when i left my eating disorder was worse than ever now nearly a decade later i have suffered from bulimia anorexia and bed all at various times so on one hand i can understand being grouped together for treatment to an extent since a lot of times they are co occurring but i still look back at those times in treatment and feel lowkey traumatized from being in such an anorexia focused center while being bulimic i do not know what point i am trying to make or if i just want to vent discuss now i am deep in restriction i do not want treatment or to open up to any mental health professional about this because last time i got help it made things worse and it made me hate myself more than ever,1,273
it will not be over until i am dead i am 20 years old and i have received treatment for my ed for 7 years now beginning when i was 13 it is still here though lurking hundreds of thousands of dollars my family has wasted on multiple treatment centers programs doctors here i am as an adult and all i tell you all i think about is being skinny i care about it more than anything else my very earliest memory from when i am guessing i was 3 or 4 is of me looking at a magazine and wondering why i was chubbier than them while i was a kid so i am supposed to be smaller obviously that is incredibly irrational but it is just always been there i struggle a lot with identity and have gone through so many phases but my ed has been there through each one it is the only thing that i can honestly say feels like me it is the only thing that can always make me feel alive as it literally kills me i am not even small anymore i used to be so good at this treatment put so much weight on me years ago and i have been able to lose about 30 pounds of that which is not a lot considering i gained about 70 i am so insecure i would say i am a pretty girl i have been blessed with great features but my body has taken a fucking beating from all of the weight fluctuation i literally look like i have had 5 children i say that because my mother has had 5 children and we have the exact same body type right now in almost every single aspect she is beautiful but fuck if i could only look like she did when she was 20 i do not know what i am doing guess i am just venting hope everyone is day is going well and if you have gotten to this point thank you for reading this genuinely could really use the validation of simply being listened to edit why the hell does my post say spoiler laughing out loud i did not put that,1,373
went out to dinner with my bf over the weekend and for the first time in literally 6 months of dating i got myself to eat everything i ordered and split dessert with him and honestly the look of pride and love he gave me from across the table might just be the thing to push me all the way to recovery i cannot stop thinking about it i love him so fucking much,1,74
so sick of living this way i cook my family s dinner every night and have to see all the amazing food they get to eat i watch them eat everything i love while i starve i eat low calorie stuff so i do not go over my 1300 cals my husband says just eat it as if it is that easy i hate caring about being skinny this shit sucks,1,71
oatmeal what is the deal with all these recovery channels where they always have oatmeal porridge in the morning for breakfast i always ate that when i was in my worst places in ed not so much in recovery not like you cannot enjoy it but it seems like almost all of them have it almost all the time,1,59
who else turns into a bloodhound when restricting its stupid and i should not but honestly i look forward to the heightened sense of smell when restricting it makes me feel like i am tasting with my nose it is like the most useless super power ever to be to identify pretty much any smell in that physical state sometimes it is nice to bake cookies or make food just to smell them i do not know just something that is on my mind today as my coworker cooks their lunch,1,91
is not it crazy how it is hard to follow your own advice that you give others like i know damn well 1 day of binging will not ruin my progress but holy fuck i get so sad man like holy shit wtf literally i felt so good over a week ago after coming off a binge cycle i felt nice i got down to 133lbs by thanksgiving i was fucking 159lbs i felt so sad i knew i gained but i did not think it would be that bad i ate like calories did not exist because i kept fucking up over and fucking over again i just said welp fuck it i ruined everything let us spiral further after thanksgiving i finally snapped back into reality and i am currently back down to 143lbs i guess i had a shit ton of water weight but then again all i ate were fucking cookies and sweets and pastries laughing out loud that is it rant over i am going to be 30 in january how the fuck am i still so fucked godddd fuck you cake for being so damn delicious,1,192
there are still good people just had such a wholesome experience at work my colleague who knows i have issues just came into my office and lent me her very personal notes and home assignments from her ed recovery journey back in 2017 how sweet is that,1,47

binge trigger identified loneliness and the idea that i will never find anyone ever i am kind of under pressure but at least i identified thre thought and how i am holding it by the throat while i can please help me it started with me reminiscing when i spent christmas with my ex boyfriend i was in control i was perfect and everyone was proud of me now i have no one i used to have a group of friends but i was dumb and did dumb things and now they want nothing to do with me i properly apologised and we discussed maturely and told me i am free to come back but then blocked me on social media right after i feel very betrayed and like i am stuck in a corner as an adult in uni i feel like now making friends is extremely hard because it is just bot school anymore you are no longer stuck with groups of peoe trying to make do everyone is got their own loves going and i feel like i am expected to have everything in place when i really do not i considered visiting this queer safe space in my city but i have another problem my mom is kind of a celebrity in my city and i am easily recognised as her child and i fear that if anyone would see me not as just a lesbian but a trans nonbinary my mom would get extremely mad she equally got mad when i came out to her and forced me to throw out all of my comfort clothes she also tends to lie a lot she can compliment me on something like my outfit or my interests but later uses those same things against me i struggle to trust people in general and i feel like i cannot get comfortable into anything i do because i am always going to do something wrong this is all that is coming to my head right now please help i am struggling and it would be essential to get a mindset or something that would help me feel more secure when thoughts like this get on top of me please help edit a detail that adds salt to my wound is the fact that my ex left me unexpectedly only a couple days after my birthday this only makes me feel more insecure that everytime i will meet someone new whom i will really get along with they will just leave with me having no control over it,1,428

chronicles of a fine dining cook with an ed 12 hour shifts putting me in a huge calorie deficit body does not lose weight due to being under so much stress no energy to make myself breakfast or dinner when i am at home only really eats during family meal time feels embarrassed eating in front of everyone even though it is normal impatiently waiting for family meal time because i am dizzy on high levels of caffeine and an empty stomach gets triggered when the one coworker who is very thin will not eat her family meal because she is too busy to chef gives her more attention and pushes her to finish her plate she is a lovely person i just feel bothered when this happens cannot focus and forgets things probably because there is not enough calories in my body to fuel my brain uses locker next to mirror so i can bodycheck whenever i am in the changeroom the constant feeling like i should not be in this kitchen because i am not as passionate about food as my coworkers are because my ed is hindering that but i still love cooking,1,196
i wish people would care ore about my health than what i look like i just had the most triggering conversation with my dad and i cannot stop crying and it feels like i will never get over it i just want to get this off my chest i asked him what expectations he has for me in life he asked me if i meant physical which felt so weird like why would he have any say in what i look like i said no and explained what i actually mean but he still ended up saying you will get mad at me for saying this but i want you to gain 2 kgs max 3 but no more than 3 i would have to gain 10 kgs to get to a barely normal bmi i am very severely underweight both my mental and physical health are shit and they were not any good at the maximum acceptable weight he has for me either i do not want to recover at the moment but i am not planning on letting this disorder kill me one day i want to be happy and make a beautiful healthy life for myself i feel like there is no way my dad would have a place in that kind of life and that hurts me so much because i love him and i know he loves me and has done a lot for me i would never say this to anyone in real life because i know i would be judged like hell but i feel like the pain of not having a dad would have been more bearable than the pain of living with the disorder i most probably would not had had if it were not for him he is the one who taught me that my weight is the most important thing about me ever since i was a little child as young as i can remember being deep into an ed erased me my personality my interests the intensity of my feelings my energy everything became only numbers numbers but when i realize that ed or not people i love and that i want to be loved by look at me and numbers is the only thing they can see too it is so hard to find motivation to get my life back i am craving for a place of love where none of this matters and we all see each other and care for one another and are good with each other but that does not exist so i hope i will figure out how to handle that and be happy despite that because right now i am not well,1,451

safe friend does anyone else have one person around whom your ed just disappears i have an amanzing friend who also struggles with food and likes a lot of the same foods as me everytime we see each other which is not that often because they life a 2h train ride away we just eat whatever and i am completely fine not sure if that would change if we spent more time together but so far it feels great,1,79
weird body observation pre ed did anyone else find themselves obsessed with certain looks even before they had a full blown ed i have vivid memories of always noticing actresses arms and how slim they were even though my ed did not start until adulthood i have always hated my arms grew up with a mom who hates hers and talked about it a lot i do not know was there anything you were weirdly observant about as a kid that is now kind of an ed obsession,1,88

recovered anorexic becoming attracted to very thin petite women years ago i started modelling at 16 and being in the business quickly lead me to developing anorexia it was a really strange time in my life and one of the most confusing up to that point no one really payed attention to me suddenly i had all this attention drawn to me which now i realize was most likely pedos i was pressed to lose weight by photographers and it was embarrassing to me but at same time i really did want to lose weight because somehow i was manipulated into believing some big dream it is all pretty clear to me now how messed up and predatory the modelling fashion industry is i started losing a lot of weight and the more weight i lost the more attention i got part of me felt horrible but a big part of me felt on top i did not really see a point of getting help at the time because i was surrounded by people telling me how great my body looked despite that i was really unhealthy and could barely finish shoots fast forward 6 years i got professional help and have been fully recovered for 2 years now i have recently found myself so admired with thinner and thinner looking girls though i do not like overly exposed bones but any girl that is very thin is such a turn on me it causes me envy too i will look at a very thin girl that i can tell is suffering from same thing i did but i will remember all the praise i got from being her size and it will release euphoria for me it like triggers my attraction to her but also sexually i am not really sure what this is or why i have recently developed these feelings part of me feels like a piece of shit maybe i am fucked up from my past i do not know just needed to vent,1,338
why do people keep gifting me food my mom sent me a box of 50 chocolates at college what am i supposed to do with that i do not want to waste it but the presence is making me anxious and a friend surprising me with sandwiches and cookies after my final i had planned to only eat a halo top today as a treat just the sandwich has more calories than the entire pint would have i feel so bad because this stuff is meant as a kind gesture but it just makes me anxious and messes with my plans and makes me waste food any tips for avoiding this and what to do with that box of chocolates i have already eaten one,1,125

feel like shit because my ill husband has been triggering my ed firstly let me just say that the past two years have been really hard for me last february i graduated from nursing school i was excited albeit a little scared to start working and make some actual money for the first time in my life then covid hit throughout school i would worked as a caregiver for an amazing disability justice activist with whom i quickly became friends she was also immunocompromised and already had respiratory issues her doctor told her flat out that if she got covid she would die i could not leave her without a caregiver in the middle of a pandemic and i could not start working at a ltc facility because i would almost guaranteed expose her so i was fine taking a paycut while we waited for the pandemic to wane before that happened she passed away in may the day after my birthday it was devastating to me and i was not able to work for six months and then that november my mil passed away it was also very sudden out of nowhere we got the call that she was in hospital with liver kidney pancreas and heart failure she was across the country and the doctors told us she probably would not survive the evening so there was no point in even trying to be there that night she coded twice thankfully that morning with the help of a family friend that used to work at that hospital my husband was about to get poa and made the compassionate decision to make her dnr she passed away just a few hours later i know it is a boomer joke to hate your mil but i loved her she was an amazingly loving woman despite all of the hardships that she would been through as a young first nation girl she would been kidnapped by the canadian government and adopted into a white mormon family in the you s she was not able to find her real family for almost thirty years because of this she developed a problem with alcohol and later other drugs i never saw her sober but she was always happy and sweet even though she was frequently homeless and she loved sending us cards even when she would lost her job due to her frequent hospitalizations which we found out after she passed was due to her failing organs and was living on the streets she would always send us cards with puppies and kittens and stickers to seal the front and she always made sure her little dog bella was well fed they found each other on the streets and they stayed together up until she passed away the only silver lining to her death was that it gave my husband the motivation to stop drinking for years he would struggled with harm reduction he would be successful for a month or so and then relapsed hard it was a huge strain on our relationship and i was so scared for his health i understood where drinking would put him but i do not think the reality of the damage alcohol does hit him until his mother passed away he has been completely sober since she passed away in january i finally felt like i could work i found a job and felt optimistic about my future my husband was sober he was due to graduate with his phd in the summer our relationship was strengthening i was looking forward to finally making money after years of constant struggle and pain we could finally build a stable life and then he was hospitalized acute hepatitis his ct scans showed no signficant cirrhosis his doctors assured us that his liver would recover with rest but three hospital visits later and he was diagnosed with end stage liver disease and then necrotizing pancreatitis and then his lungs started to fail then his kidneys by august he would been in the icu for a week and he was expected to pass away i quit my job indefinitely to spend as much time with him as i could miraculously he recovered not all the way he would still need a liver transplant but he was able to be released from hospital i have not gone back to work i have been his full time caregiver which means money is tight and then the cherry on top after my husband was finally discharged not for the last time as he is been to the hospital twice again but for much shorter less critical visits our beloved dog hazel was diagnosed with lung cancer there was absolutely no way we could afford the surgery to remove the cancer so i held a fundraiser and begged every friend i had and managed to raise enough money for her she had a lobectomy and has been healing wonderfully but there is no guarantee that some of the cancer cells have already metastized it is just a waiting game to see if another tumor grows all of this is to say that i am so stressed my depression has become extremely severe i have never had anxiety before but now it is eating away at my sanity my self loathing is bubbling like lava in my mind and because all of this my mental strength has become incredibly frail part of my husband s care is that his diet has to be extremely regulated he has to have a low fat low sodium moderate protein diet and because he lost half to pancreas to necrotizing pancreatitis he is now insulin dependent so his carbs have to be counted to ensure i am giving his enough insulin half of my day is spent planning weighing and cooking all his meals i have not thought this much about food since i was in the grips of my ed and i have to weigh him every morning and take his abdominal girth and now that stupid little voice is starting to whisper in my ear the worst part is the way that seeing my husband s body has affected me i hate that this idiot part of my brain looks at his thin malnourished body at his ribs and shoulder blades and spindly legs and thinks that i want that i miss that it is getting so hard not to start restricting again to start exercising again i know that i cannot afford to do this my ed again financially physically mentally but it is still calling to me every time i am weighing each piece of his meal down to the gram every time i look at his body or massage his sore muscles muscles that are so wasted that all i can feel under his skin are bones i am sorry for all the ranting i mostly just needed to get this off my chest i feel terrible my husband is sick and hurting and i am trying my best to be resolute and strong for him but i do not know if i can without my mind breaking,1,1195
why should i recover i just cannot bring myself wanting to recover can you list some valid or maybe scary reasons that could make me want to recover,1,28
i hate christmas i cannot think of anything worse than the next week or so just the culture of eating as much as you physically can and being around family watching you i am already struggling with weight gain and this is going to make everything so much worse i want to just curl up and sleep until it is all over every day i just cry at the thought of xmas and just uh do not feel you need to reply i just had to vent,1,87

identity crisis because of ed does anyone else feel like their entire identity is based on being someone with an eating disorder because of my bulimia and other mental health issues i lost interest in everything i used to enjoy dance reading movies and i genuinely have no idea who i am i do not mean this in a corny way but i literally do not know i cannot tell what my favorite color is what music artists i prefer my style or anything if i do decide to get help then what is life going to look like on the other side that uncertainty is a big part of why i am so scared to talk to anyone,1,119
i live in anticipation of the scale going down tomorrow morning and that is it that is it it would be a sick joke if i did not lose a pound after the weeks of restriction i put myself through,1,40
i want chocolate unsafe fear food for me okay so i am feeling pretty low and there is a box of lindt chocolate beside me my favourite and i want some but i feel really guilty everyone else is eating chocolate and other sweets especially because it is christmas but i feel like i should be better than that i know that i will feel guilty but i really want some i am not even really thin so i feel like i do not have permission i am also one of those people who are really supportive and encouraging towards others but very harsh on myself so i would never say that other people do not deserve food i am torn between feeling guilty and actually wanting to just live and just enjoy something like millions of others seem to manage to do,1,143
to my 7 year old self i know that you are panicking about how the scale is not pointing 27 kgs anymore how you gained 3 more over the weekend i know that all you want is to weigh 25 kgs again these things are eating up your brain and all you want is to feel okay again feel lighter again i wish i could go back and tell you to eat that piece of birthday cake i wish could tell you to live life carefree and turn a blind eye towards the evil in the world i wish i could tell you to forget what the doctor said i wish i could tell you it is all in your head how you look like you are on the verge of death i wish i could let you know the road ahead only gets harder 7 years down the line it has not gotten any better throught the years your weight will fluctuate but one thing shall remain constant your association of thinness with true happiness more than anything i wish you knew the things i would give now to look like you,1,193
anybody else have a horribly stubborn area of fat tw a rant about my stubborn fat mentions of weight weight gain i have recently gained some weight and i absolutely hate it while i am technically on the lower end of normal i feel soft and squishy and disgusting i hate touching my hips and back and feeling a significant softness and having my fingers sink into it i literally feel fat i feel the fat on myself i am embarrassed to show myself to people at my university honestly i am glad that masks are mandatory most of my weight gain tends to show in my thighs and hips sometimes my lower belly and words cannot express how much i hate it i wish that i could take a knife and peel off the fat like peeling a carrot without you know bleeding to death or developing some kind of horrible infection and or scarring what is worse is that even when i am at a lower weight the size of my thighs remains irritatingly constant they refuse to lose fat or lose only very small amounts i will lose fat in my arms and face and upper body until i look extremely gaunt but my thighs remain nearly the same until i dip into the very underweight range it is just all around uncomfortable and i hate when my body looks softer and womanly or whatever the hell my calves look weirdly small in comparison to my thighs i can feel my butt jiggle when i run my face is annoyingly round maybe science says that a pear shaped fat distribution is healthier for fat storage than the upper abdomen is increased likelihood of visceral fat with a more apple shaped fat distribution but thanks i hate it,1,300
soooo i am not sure how we got here but i am currently cross legged on my dorm room floor eating plain hearts of palm out of a jar with chopsticks illuminated only by my aesthetic ass christmas lights tomorrow morning at 8am i take an applied mathematics final at one of the top 20 universities in america no i have not been studying but i have gotten my sodium intake for the day in one sitting,1,77

i just threw my back out purging pleaseee be careful if you are going to purge hello all i am a 28 year old female been purging about two three years now i am the type who will purge any little thing if i feel like it is enough to make me gain some days i feel like 5 m ms will make me gain some days i feel like a cup of water will make me gain it is depressing i know i have been dieting lately and decided to binge on some doughnut holes that i saw at the grocery store today i live alone and i love it but i do have a slight fear of something happening to me and no one being around to help whelp this is the second time something has happened to me because of my ed and i was completely alone i purge in the shower it is a bad habit i picked up on when i was in between homes at one point i purge in a bucket in the shower and flush it when i am done purging in a bucket i feel is a bit more rough than the toilet as i have to really bend over should mention that i am 5  8 i had just finished gorging myself with doughnut holes when i decided that after 10 minutes or so it was time to rid of it i am in the shower doing my thing and realized that it was going to be a little tough getting it all out when i decided to try harder as i went to heave it happened to be too hard on my body and then i felt my lower back pop followed by a very sharp pain when i tried to stand up straight from being in a bent position there was so much pain i managed to stand up straight but could not bend over again and i could barely turn or walk without a sharp pain as i stood in front of my mirror in pain and terror i asked myself why i was doing this to myself i immediately went to the emergency room scared that i ruined my back the doctor told me i pulled my lower back muscle gave me meds and said that i needed to take it easy for awhile the sickening part is that all i could think about is how i will not be able to purge for a while i am currently in bed depressed and ashamed and dumbfounded as to how i am going to pay my 491 hospital bill,1,442
cannot admit to this eds are competitive and we all know that but does anyone else feel that they cannot admit to theirs because then they will lose like i am definitely not the best disordered person but if i am effortlessly this size then i am winning,1,48
does anyone here hoard new stuff sometimes i buy myself things with the intention of using them immediately but there is always that stupid little piece of shit part of my brain that says that i am not allowed to use them until i am at a low weight enough this also applies to gifts as well mom always gives me soaps perfumes and especially clothing sometimes i just section off an entire part of my wardrobe that i am not allowed to wear yet i am not in a relapse right now nor am i underweight but the fact that i still have these thoughts are pretty fking annoying,1,110
it never really gets better does it i am almost 30 years old i just got my first big girl corporate job wfh starting in january i also just recently hit my lw again somehow i honestly do not even know how i guess i can attribute it to tons of stress and next to no alcohol anymore my therapist knows i have an ed but we just pretend like it does not exist i wonder when she will question me on it again maybe when i faint in her office anyway besides that i am just sitting here thrilled my job is remote so i can continue my unhealthy lifestyle with no kickback from comments of coworkers bosses or having to eat enough to sustain a commute and perform well pathetic honestly,1,133
does anyone else kind of blame their parents for their ed but also really love them and feel kind of bad for them despite being annoyed i feel like my mom actively encouraged things that led to disordered eating basically encouraging me to go through periods of overeating and then subsequently cutting large parts of my diet out on one hand it is upsetting for her to continue to do these things on her own and encourage me to do the same but on the other hand i feel bad for her when she talks about it just the other day i mentioned that sometimes i will have fruit for breakfast but have recently gotten into cutting it up and putting it in plain cereal and her reaction was just to remind me that there is sugar in fruit and go on about how she rigorously avoids sugar entirely i tried to explain how it is ok in moderation and one piece of fruit will not hurt but she just kept insisting that it is bad either way i feel like lately i have had a lot of moments of clarity where i saw things that i hate in myself in her and while it is upsetting that she kind of gave these thoughts to me it is equally upsetting to see how the same thing exists in her knowing how much i hate it in myself like she is along with many others also been kind of depressed lately and while part of me just wants to spit the stupid just do not be sad rhetoric back that she has said to me time and time again i also know how frustratingly unhelpful that is and do not want to make her feel worse does anyone else get that feeling where you understand that some of your problems can be traced directly back to your parents but instead of just blaming them and being mad kind of feel sorry and understand how unaware they are of these shared issues,1,340
do i still have an eating disorder if i eat at a maintenance first of all i am not sure if this is the right flair if it is not please tell me also tw numbers just to be sure edit i try to put the spoiler thingy over the number but it will not work sorry i have reached my ugw like we say a while ago while doing high restricting this on itself makes already feel extremely invalid but that is another problem the problem is i would love to up my calories a little bit so i can eat a bit more for more energy to exercise feel a little free er while keeping the body that i have which i admit to is not a healthy one my only problem is that i feel super invalid about even wanting to do that i want to eat around my maintenance which is too high and scary for now but like around 1400cals sounds alright do i still have an ed when i eat that much i feel like a failure even thinking about it does anyone else struggle with this,1,193
everyone is favorite binge orexic who cannot eat anything but sweets is back on her crap just ate half an entire babka and i hate myself but i cannot eat a damn sandwich or single slice of pizza what is wrong with me i often confuse people,1,47
i miss when i did not think about food and my weight all the time i feel like i genuinely do not remember what it was like to have casual thoughts that do not revolve around food or my weight even if i am afforded the simple luxury of an alternate thought i immediately snap back to food and my body i was not always like this but i have been like this for so long i cannot imagine being any other way like what do people who are not obsessed with food and numbers think about,1,97
i miss lockdown and people not seeing my physical form i have to go to a christmas party on saturday at a waterpark and because of covid this will be the first time in 2 years that i will have to wear a bathing suit in front of people 2 years ago i was 16 and tiny and i tried on that swimsuit i wore back then and i ripped the seam putting the bottoms on i just stared at myself in the mirror and was wondering if i even want to go all i could see is how i am like twice the size of 16 year old me i know i gained all the weight in lockdown which is like because i became a gym rat and starting restricting but second puberty is a serious bitch but god do i miss being inside all the time and not having people see me anyway catch me crying on saturday because my only bathing suit is small enough to cut my circulation,1,172
do you all ever have difficulty breathing while laying down yup i am getting concerned,1,15
anyone else crying in their room after the christmas food binge just hoping i can restrict again i have probably undone 7 days of restriction weight loss in 2 days and i am scared this means i am pushed back another week until my first gw,1,46
does anyone else feel invalidated by recovery pages i want to recover i want the motivation to recover so i will find some recovery pages i figured but the thing is each one i come across gears towards restrictive eds that is totally fine that they do but i feel sad because my ed primarily involves binging and the rare non food consumption getting told it is ok to eat is fine and all but i wish there were tips like here is how to relieve a stomach ache after a binge or how to redirect your cravings from non food to food or something getting told halo top is not suitable icecream is not too helpful for me i just want to feel supported and like i am still a worthy person even though i binge and gain weight regularly,1,141
had the best christmas of my life and i did not even care that much about the food i just enjoyed my partner was super proud of me and i had my first genuinely happy christmas party in this country people do it on the 24th and it was just friends and i was stressed and i have been eating 3 meals a day and i have even stopped bloating super badly i am also takinh some type of rebalance pils for my stomach so that is nice and i fit into pants i have not worn in years and it was really nice to boost my ego and now i am hungover and feel kind of sick but its worth it and it was lovely and i am proud of myself,1,132
no one in this family eats my mom like bro do you eat it is annoying when she acts like people under eating in the house is such a huge issue like please leave me alone and let me do my thing,1,42
ed but i do not care about being fat thin i hate eating i hate the feeling of being full i get hungry but food always seems repulsive to me but i could not care less about looking thin maybe as a sort of trophy in that it shows what a bitterness and sadness i am feeling but even in that sense not all that much for about a month i fast four days a week and eat as little as i can get away with on the other three i am worried this might fuck my brain and my ability to think which is my job i am worried it will fuck up my gut flora but i just hate eating so much what is this,1,127
the but you look beautiful when i say i feel bad about my body triggers the hell out of me that is honestly it maybe i m an ungrateful spoiled cunt that cannot accept a compliment but i hate it with all my might when someone calls me sexy it is even more triggering my ed is not because wanting to be like a model or being sexually attractive i despise being sexualized in any way too many people sexualized me without my consent and now i cannot stand it in any way it just makes me want to damage myself savagely and become ugly just to prove that i m fucking hurting when i hear that it makes me fell so gaslit invalid and stupid i am not asking for compliments i expressing sadness and discomfort please listen i wish i could say this to people in real life but if i do not accept a compliment people gets angry offended and hateful,1,164
ed showing itself in the starbucks parking lot not me order three espresso shots over ice and bringing my own sugar cookie skinny syrup and almond milk so i can taste the sugar cookie almond milk latte i have craved for weeks pathetic,1,43

do you ever try to trigger yourself everytime i gain weight i get to the point where i am like oh shit and then i try to trigger myself into losing it again because i can never lose it with a healthy mind,1,43
what the actual fuck i think i broke myself trigger warning for numbers but someone please tell me this is at least somewhat normal i am literally losing it so for this past month and a half i have been preparing for christmas by restricting a lot like 200 400 cals a day i got down to a bmi of 16 7 of course that has been its own hell and i would not wish it on anyone but this weekend i just broke i started eating and i have not stopped since i feel absolutely disgusting it is not like a normal amount if i even still know what that looks like but it is like full blown binges multiple times a day i am so angry with myself because i was supposed to save it for christmas i purge just because i cannot stand the painful full feeling in my stomach and yet i am still hungry even now i still want more if i keep this up i will be obese by the time winter break ends if anyone has gone through something similar please help what do i do,1,193
anyone want to chat restricting for weeks on end especially around christmas time is making me lose my mind anyone else out there struggling feel free to direct message me,1,30
any other teens who cannot wait for adulthood i am a junior in high school and i fantasize about about being restricted to the foods i buy for myself i think about all of the extra money i will have because i am not spending it on food its scary to me the way i have romanticized the idea of wasting away but i feel like either starving or binging is all i am capable of doing,1,77
stop commenting about people s bodies so i lost a lot of weight throughout this year through ed relapse and exercise addiction and recently i was diagnosed with pcos and since i have not had a period in months the gyno started me on hormones which has caused obvious bloating my sister who is unaware of my issues decided it was a good idea to make a remark about how i blew up since i moved home for the holidays and i must have been eating nonstop and now i just feel like utter shit,1,95
looked up ex boyfriend for old time s sake and disappointed myself scrolling through google docs and clearing old files out i stumbled upon a document we both had access to and decided to look him up which brought up his instagram which brought up his new abs you could grate cheese on boyfriend and their so happy i found you 3 posts now i am just sitting in my office thinking about how many pounds i have yet to lose,1,81
i think the guy i just started dating has an ed ok so i recently met this really cute guy and he is really sweet and we have a lot in common however i am really concerned that he has an ed because of things i picked up in our conversations so he works out everyday for 3 hours and he does intermittent fasting so he only eats one meal a day which is dinner he said that he likes to challenge himself and push his limits by restricting different foods as a form of self control and he rarely messes up we are both in uni and he is living at home with his very rich and very very strict parents and i think that that is his way of taking control of his life i also struggle a lot with eating and eds but he does not trigger me nor do these conversations we have they just make me sad sad for him i am kind of starting to understand how an outsider looks at an ed but i do not know how to relate my struggles to his like my brain cannot even make that connection any ideas on what i could do to help,1,208
shout out to the time 10 years ago i stayed with my then boyfriend s parents for the first time and his dad told me he should dump me because she has an eating disorder neat eh just mulling that one over again my ex had told him at the time i know she struggled with that in the past and he was like no she does she has one i do not know why he was so sure and why he thought that meant his son should run from the relationship but okay thanks for reminding me brain everytime i think about this first christmas with my new boyfriend s family,1,112

loosing feeling in toes does anyone ever loose feeling in their toes sorta like when they go numb when it is cold but this time it is not just when i am cold they are turning blue as well which normally just happens to my fingers today i even lost feeling in my heels while i was walking around does anyone know what the because is and if it is related to my restriction is it dangerous,1,77
no friends and no energy to make new ones this is probably the thing i hate the most about having an ed i have no friends long and rather uninteresting story and i seriously cannot find the motivation or energy to make new ones and i know it is because of my restrictive ed it prevents me from going out and socializing because i am scared of what i might have to eat in social situations but mostly i just do not have any energy at all to do anything other than go through my everyday life and focus on just surviving it sucks and i am so controlled by food it is ridiculous i feel like the only thing that will help is recovery but i am so so scared of recovery i am scared of gaining all the weight that i have lost back possibly tw i am not even close to underweight so i feel like i am just making shit up even though logically i know i am not i do not know where i want to go with this but words of advice or encouragement or just something would be appreciated i am tired of feeling lonely and scared,1,204
does anyone else feel embarrassed during sex i hate my boobs i do not feel like taking off my bra or even my top most of the time i used to have decent b c cup breasts when i was a normal weight 5 3 115 lbs and they have shrunk to small b s if i am being generous i am now 94 lbs my boyfriend hates that i have lost weight and i feel so self conscious during sex it is uncomfortable he does not comment that much but just tells me i need to eat more i just feel really sad angry embarrassed ashamed that i cannot fully enjoy being intimate,1,114
i do not want to recover anymore hello all it is been a while for the last two months i have been in a residential treatment facility for my anorexia i traveled across multiple states to get here i am still in the process of weight restoring i do not want to recover anymore i came here extremely motivated ready to get better wanting it now i do not i want to leave i am just going through the motions i eat the food and attend the groups but my brain is farthest from recovery focused i daydream about my relapse i plan to have once i leave it is all i can think about i do not trust my treatment team and i do not want to share these thoughts with them i know i have at least two more months to go before i am allowed to leave if my calculations are correct they will not ever tell me my dates the weight they want to put me at is higher than i have ever been in my life i refuse to stay at that weight if i try to leave now they will almost definitely have me legally bound to be here because i am not technically weight restored and besides that my parents would not let me come home were i to leave before the team s recommendations i do not know what i am looking for by posting this i guess i just needed to share it with someone i do not want recovery i hate every aspect of this and i want to go back i plan to go back and this is not a temporary wig out that i am having i have felt this way about the process for nearly a month now i just cannot bring myself to care about this and i feel like i am only doing it so my mom does not freak out and to get out of here,1,332
whenever someone says excuse me i feel fat yes i am that disordered,1,13
does anyone else s ed affect them in their dreams so i have had an eating disorder since i was a teenager and within the last few months i have been noticing that even when i am dreaming it still seems to have so much control over me quite often i will eat something in a dream and feel that exact same shame and regret that i feel when i am awake it is always a mixture of emotions when this happens because i wake up at first feeling so relieved that i did not actually eat anything but then i really think about it and i just feel so hopeless how am i supposed to recover from this when i have let it get to this point i have not seen any posts about this before but it is been bothering me a lot and this is one of the only places i feel comfortable talking about these things,1,160
does anyone s ed return to look good for an event i have a music festival in 11 days and need to lose fat so fast i have not even planned my outfit and am already planning on my exercise restriction and laxative abuse laughing out loud i feel so insecure not being as tall as other girls i am 5 1 2 and feel proportionally large for my size and that my bf will check out all these really beautiful toned rave girls and cannot cope with the thought i know it is toxic and incredibly self damaging but i cannot help it,1,104
do any of you actually prefer liquid calories calorie dense foods it seems like it is very much the norm for anas to eat high volume low calorie stuff in order to create a sensation of fullness without weight gain a lot of people also seem to prefer clean n healthy but utterly unsatisfying low cal foods like plain apple slices or mostly lettuce salads i sometimes feel like a fraud because i prefer to eat more calorie dense small serving foods like pastries or liquid calories like fancy lattes and alcohol anyone else do the same i guess the thing i have realized recently is sensations of fullness freak me out a bit now and i feel like i am being a good anorexic if i go to bed with hunger pangs even if i did eat a reasonable amount of calories that day i know i am at least not the only one who basks in that morning skinni clean empty feeling i am currently making a half assed attempt to stop restricting in order to build muscle but having to eat a lot of protein is kind of distressing because i feel like i am bloated all the time yet stuck eating foods that are totally unsatisfying for my sweet tooth for me it is always been more about maximizing pleasure i e getting to eat the foods i want while striving for the body i want and nutritionally bankrupt portion control was how i struck that balance but now i feel like i am losing that and it is making me a lil crazy there is also just this nagging feeling of having been a fake all along because i never accomplished that monastic denial of food pleasure some people seem to have going on i do not know what to make of it all anyone else in a similar boat what emotions come up for you around sensations of fullness vs emptiness is hunger a feeling you bury or relish does enjoyment still factor into your food choices,1,343
are you vegan because of your ed or for ethical reasons i feel like it is difficult to differentiate between the two if you struggle with an ed sometimes you convince yourself it is for ethical reasons that is what i did but sometimes all you want to actually do is cut off as much food as possible if that makes sense,1,62
does anyone else have these wtf am i doing with my life moment i was just frantically chewing biscuits and bread before spitting them down the toilet when i realized how messed up and abnormal this is i now feel completely and utterly pathetic,1,44

christmas and so it begins been trying not to relapse fully the last 3 months and semi succeeding i had one egg as breakfast this morning before christmas lunch i am aussie so its already christmas here and my dad goes oink oink may the love of jesus be with me today,1,52
tiny dreams i do not want to just be small i want to be tiny i want to look as fragile as i feel inside i want people to look at me and think i better be careful because i look like i will break and shatter everywhere if i am not handled correctly i want to fit into tiny spaces and have people wonder how the hell i am comfortable in them i wish 00 jeans were too big on me i wish i fit into tiny asian sizes for clothing i want my friends to be able to pick me up easily i want the girl i like to put her arm around my waist and notice how small it is i want to be able to sit on someone is lap and not fall off because i am too heavy,1,143
how do people eat like normal people without gaining weight i just literally do not understand i was in an amazing rhythm of consistent weight loss for like 5 years i lost like 70 pounds by barely trying just calorie counting and walking around a lot because i lived in a big city i got so thin it was crazy then i met my bf and we started to eat out a lot i never ate out he eats healthy but he cooks with oil and i cannot even ever count any of the calories and i thought i was working enough to offset it but laughing out loud i lowkey think hiit which i started to offset the lack of movement because of covid was stressful on my body and with the non deficit i was eating most days i gained like 30 pounds in 2020 3 finding out my weight gain was one of the worst days of my life i literally made myself overweight again laugh my ass off we will eat like chicken pasta or a salad that is just chicken spinach and parm flakes and it will be lentil pasta but cheese olive oil fuck i lost most of it because i was away from my bf for a while in a different state but now we are in the same place and together in the evenings most days and every single day i am with him i overeat if even just a little and i literally never can have a deficit day with him there is always something i eat that i cannot count and it makes me so upset and then i become a shitty depressed girlfriend always in a bad mood i spiral into depression and get so upset feeling so out of control i want to lose weight and feel in control of my body i feel so free when i am away from him because then once again i am in control and am not subject to treats and things i cannot count i am now realizing that in order to be with him eat his cooking which i love and just generally enjoy alcohol and and stuff with him that i have to literally not eat all day long and just save all my calories for being with him i truly do not know how the fuck else i can do this otherwise i am literally just going to keep gaining weight i am never going to reach my goals this is kind of unreal i want to do if and just save cals until like 3 or later but i literally cannot go without eating before noon it is so fucking hard for me i feel sick i cannot even have a cute little latte because it will set off my hunger but nothing but water until the afternoon how the fuck how do people live normal lives without gaining weight it is sick that i feel like the only way i can keep my body how i want is by staying single,1,515
scale helps me does anyone else feel like having a scale keeps their habits from getting out of control when i was first really sick i did not have a scale but had horrendous body dysmorphia and did not realize how much weight i had lost until far down the line when i finally weighed myself it was only then that i fully understood how sick i was i know weight loss extreme physical changes are not a symptom for everyone but that was a big thing for me now i use a scale and i feel like because i know for a fact that i am losing weight it helps keep my behaviors reasonable if you can even call them that rather than me assuming i have lost no weight and pushing myself further i know scales are super triggering for some but i feel like having one helps me immensely,1,152
my friend is really into dieting i have started self recovery i have accepted the fact that i am not ok and should recover by myself so i am starting to eat more and more fear foods and trying to overcome my ed but my best friend who is really insecure about her body as well is currently on a diet and she keeps telling me about how many calories are in what i eat and will not eat what i eat and keeps telling me about her weight loss just a lil rant i was stressed out the other day after meeting her for dinner,1,106
ed poops literally hate this disorder so much i hate not eating for 3 5 days then as soon as i eat i have to poop the nastiest shit i have ever seen smelled especially when you are chilling with homies do not want them to know you are disordered so you eat normally then literally shit your pants someone please tell me they relate i hate this right now literally blew up my homies bathroom,1,76
hit my gw now what trigger warning because things feel bleak this is a vent i am at my goal weight it is not underweight in fact it is over still i guess i feel at a loss of course i still am depressed life still feels empty it feels even harder to breathe at times after exertion i walked across the street into a coffee shop today with my heart almost pounding itself out and up through my mouth i am not even restricting that badly i think my goal is still to simply keep going until there is nothing left because i consider it a less direct way of committing suicide i just worry about something happening while i drive and getting someone else involved getting someone hurt or not dying and ending up paralyzed and in permanent debt i worry that my organs and tissues will be useless for donation i do not know what the point of this is be safe sorry to be a bummer,1,170

anyone else obsessed with baking cooking like since halloween where i thought haha it would be fun to try and bake some seasonal goods i have been obsessed i do not even crave to eat it it is just genuinely fun to do and i usually give it away to my family friends neighbors like people have started giving me cooking stuff because of my new found obsession with baking,1,70
my binges do not feel like binges when i binge i feel like it is my bodies only way of staying alive and not just an out of control moment i am fully in control when i binge however my thought process is more like i need to stay alive because usually when i binge it is when my heart rate is beating very low on my fitbit and i feel very weak anyone else experience this,1,77
guilt for eating normally does anyone else feel extreme guilt feel like they have binged after a completely normal day of eating the past couple days my ed seems to have escaped me as i have had around 2 300ish calories 3 healthy meals a day which is around maintenance for me and i feel extremely guilty like i have been binging and like i need to restrict again for literally eating normally my brain is screaming at me for eating a healthy normal amount,1,85
at what bmi weight do people usually get hospitalised i am 16f and worried that i might be severely underweight,1,20
sugar cravings i have never been interested in sugary foods but now that i am restricting losing i suddenly want all the sugar things i think maybe it is because simple carbs sugar is easier for the body to turn into energy has anyone else experienced this,1,47
i believe ed myths you do not gain weight because of one bad day o really because it is been 2 days and the scale is still going up,1,29
unironically afraid of dying on the toilet i just spent an hour fighting for my life on the toilet and at some point my heart started acting kind of funky i began feeling really dizzy and cold and lowkey started freaking out it went away after like 3 minutes and i feel fine now but i legit thought my last moments were going to be spent shitting,1,67
genuine question for people with a lot of anxiety so when you are really anxious do you get constipated or shit yourself,1,22
moratorium for the size my jeans were before i washed tbem will be screaming throwing up and doing jean on lunges for the rest of the day rip,1,28
i am so depressed that i do not feel hunger anymore and it is easy for me to restrict i do not think about anything i do not want to keep myself alive so naturally i have lost the will to eat atleast its helping me lose weight which i would have wanted anyways the only difference is i have to try less hard this way,1,66
i feel like the people that are helping me are actually making me lose my mind and get worse posted this in another sub but it is fitting here too i 17f heavily restricted for two weeks a couple weeks ago one meal a day and lost a considerable amount of weight which made my parents notice and freak out i had already been reducing my portions and everything for several months maybe around four everything has gone downhill pretty quickly anyway my parents do not trust me at all when i tell them that i ate my lunch at school i ve frequently tossed it out or given it to my friends and said i ate it they insist on asking my friends which is horrifying and they have done so several times today i ate in a teacher s office who is really chill and now my mom is forcing me to have the teacher email her to confirm i ate it i hate this so much i literally cannot anymore i want people to leave me alone i do not care about what happens i need my parents to stop annoying me and interfering with everything i hate everything about me already i do not want them to get more involved is it just me or having people tell you that you do not eat enough really makes you want to get worse like people are noticing that there is a difference and you feel more valid because of it i do not know maybe i am actually crazy,1,262
holidays are so difficult i feel so conflicted internally on one hand i want to recover i want to get better and enjoy life with my family on the other hand i have the extreme urge to restrict to say no to gatherings where food will be available to starve myself i am so uncomfortable when i eat and i am also uncomfortable when i do not eat because it feels like i am failing my family and myself i am so tired of this inner conflict i feel like i will inevitably gain weight if i keep trying to improve and that terrifies me so much i just want to be at peace with myself how have your holidays been like,1,122
does anyone else feel invalid specifically because they do not have any fear foods i am not sure why i want to validate myself so bad but i feel like i am not allowed to acknowledge that i am struggling and that i am going through the same thing so thousands of people in this sub and millions of people around the world go through so many people with eds have sad meals and tasteless food when they eat their fear foods even within their calorie limit even in a small amount they feel terribly guilty there are people that have not eaten certain foods in years or have not eaten outside at restaurants or fast food places in years it is obvious that i have it so much better for example i had chocolate today i had cookies i had bread i mean that is not all i ate and obviously it was in small quantities within my calorie limit but would a disordered person eat those foods that is what i notice telling myself all the time despite the fact that i experience so many other disordered eating related things relate to so many other things others go through i will never feel real unless i cut out all of the foods that those other people fear and become the same kind of miserable specifically because of fearing and avoiding all of those certain foods because they have the struggle and i feel like i have no right to speak of myself when they go through so much worse,1,261
i hate how much time i waste over my ed why does it take me hours just to decide whether or not i am going to eat today ughh and i cannot do anything actually productive because all i can think about is the consequences of eating or not eating everything feels so impossible,1,54
do not you ever just do something to see how far you can get i have reached my goal weight some time ago and i have been wondering what to do and if i will try to actively try to get better and today at dinner my mom was talking about her issue with overworking herself and she did it to see how far she can get and that was such a realisation to me for what i am doing,1,80
what if i just   did not have a body anymore because if i did not have a body i would not have to worry about what it looked like or what other people think about it and whether or not people like me because of what my body looks like you cannot place all of your self worth on your physical appearance if you do not have one,1,68
having an ed in a relationship i feel like my ed has convinced me that my bf would find me instantly disgusting and unlovable if i gained the tiniest bit of weight he tells me all the time that he loves me more than anything and thinks i am beautiful no matter what but my disordered mind still cannot seem to divorce my weight from his attraction to me i fucking hate it because i love him with my whole heart and i want him to be as separate as possible from this horrible twisted side of me how do you guys deal with this it is literally crippling and i hate how he is constantly worried about me i feel like such a burden i just want him to be able to enjoy life and i feel like i just take and take and take it is the worst feeling ever i know i need to gain weight but i cannot because i am convinced that i would lose him if i did fuck,1,175
some music is triggering i feel like it is only me who feels this way but like some music is so triggering and i literally use it to fuel my illness like whenever i feel the urge to binge or something i put it on like that shit is like thinspo to me i do not know how to explain it this is lowkey funny,1,65
i just want someone to know how hard i am trying to survive sorry gals this is a pretty depressing rant but i kind of want to let it out i just wish people knew how fucking hard i am trying to live another day i wish they knew that sometimes getting up from my bed feels like a chore and not a blessing i wish they knew that i did not choose to be this way but i am trying my best always but sometimes it is simply not enough because living with this fucking shit is hard,1,99
i love my mother in law but ughfjd went to france to visit my in laws and my gorgeous 90 pound mil told me she is worried about my health cus i have gained a significant amt of weight in the last couple years and now looks like i am back on my shit fuck my life,1,57
what is the point why should i recover why my family loved when i was actively anorexic instead of stepping on eggshell all the time i was more mature more intelligent more confident and more attractive i was functional enough to work to study to live fair enough i was always cold and bine thin and in pain constantly fair enough my heart sometimes played up and my head was stuck in dismal rituals now in recovery though i am all of that plus constant chronic stomach complaints with none of the positives therapy does not work eating does not work medicine does not work meditation does not work i cannot sleep i cannot think i cannot work i ahve no friends no motivation to recover no reason to exist outside of my disorder are some people terminally anorexic is it like cancer can some people just not recover,1,149
school food tastes so good when you are starving everyone at my school always complains about how shitty the food is but to me it is like some next level gourmet shit i had some terrible pepperoni pizza today and it was god tier greasy af too i ate it so fast and felt so happy and full after eating it then again maybe my starving body is just like finally some fucking food because damn that school food has been hitting different lately,1,84
i want to get something off my chest tw talk about diets and weight loss a year ago i got into blackpink and back then i was kind of an idiot so i believed them when they said they do not diet or that they eat a lot but you know what even my ed brain tells me that i eat a lot and that i do not diet but i do watch what i eat and i do skip meals regarding how much weight all the girls lost for their comebacks the only way that i know that can happen is if you watch what you eat or you restrict your eating because if you are working out and practicing then your food intake should increase along with it but if you only work out and do not increase your food intake something like what happened to taylor swift happens to you you pass out after concerts later taylor admits that after she started recovering from her ed she did not pass out and could full shows and still have energy left and this is something rosé mentioned in her documentary after a point your body gives up on you and they do not even do that many shows because they do not have that many songs is this not a because for concern the fact that you can see her bones and ribs poking out is just scary her knees go red sometimes from simple bending the fact that her arms and legs also remind me of eugenia cooney so do not fucking tell me she eats a lot,1,271
there is fear foods but does anyone else have fears of getting illnesses associated with weight gain more i promise i do not mean this in a disrespectful way but i have always have fear of getting hypothyroidism because a lot of people say it makes it hard to lose weight and easy to gain weight since your thyroid is acting up whenever i get cold and constipated often i worry it is my thyroid failing and hypo developing another illness pcos i hear it can because insulin resistance i fear having any major surgeries because i do not know how my body would react to the aftermath and might because weight gain for seemingly for no reason again no disrespect just wanted to say this,1,126
does anyone else only feel comfortable eating in front of others i know many people have a fear of eating in public i realized recently i am more comfortable eating with others especially my partner and i am way less likely to purge afterwards and have feelings of guilt it also feels like i accomplished a social activity where eating alone feels like a waste almost i am curious if anyone else experiences this,1,74
does anyone else get this in the cold i cannot post the image but every now and then in cold weather my hands circulation cuts off my fingers go numb for 15 mins my finger goes white and my fingernails tinge blue the blue thing happens frequently anyone else get this i ask to see if its an ed related issue or something else,1,64
drinking my respect myself juice i do shipt and they are doing a bonus today if you do 8 orders i was doing a second order when i started getting really really hungry usually i would just ignore it because i know the hunger sensation would go away soon and my brain tries to rationalize it by saying i should not take breaks so i can have a better chance at getting the bonus however i was also getting hangry and because of the anger issues that can come with bipolar cptsd i was starting to feel close to an adult temper tantrum so basically i told my eating disorder voice to shut up because i am more likely to get 8 orders done if i go have lunch so i am not hangry and have more energy than i would be if i tried to ignore the hunger and have a rage fit because once i get angry i stay angry for hours and every time that happens i give up on working until i am not angry which would completely eliminate my chances of doing 8 orders so i went home and am eating lunch just proud of myself for ignoring the little ed goblin in my brain trying to utilize my stress about money to get what it wants usually i just listen to it so yeah,1,230
eds and loneliness having an ed for me has meant constantly cancelling plans   never socializing   have been single for years even though i have come across guys i like travelling is scary due to lack of control over food   addiction to checking the scale all this is terribly lonely as well as all the other psych damage anyone else relate how do you get past this part even if i let loose a bit one night the next week i will not makes building relationships impossible i cannot be in an environment where i cannot control my food it is impossible for me but i cannot take the loneliness anymore and hiding it all from everyone i know,1,118
how was your christmas mine was awful my parents did not want me to come home so i stayed on campus we had a big quarrel but it is nothing out of the ordinary our relationship is not good in the first place all i did was b p all day and i felt miserable hope you enjoyed your own,1,60
substance abuse and a rant tw speed fatphobia i guess i really really really want to get some speed after 2 years of not using it i never was an addict but now i have started to crave it not because i want to have fun at a party but i want to occasionally casually do lines just so i can get shit done and to be honest so i can lose my appetite i am in quarantine right now and shit is getting boring i do not know how to not eat eat and eat i am a blob and i hate it i feel so squishy and fat none of my clothes feel comfortable and i do not feel attractive at all i want to use the biggest clothes i can find but then i look more fat skin tight clothes just reveal how fat i am i am miserable because i have to sell my old favorite jeans because i am too fucking fat to fit in them i used to be skinny effortlessly but now i am just a piece of wobbling fat who cannot even look in the mirror without cringeing,1,196
comments made by nurses warning i do not want to share numbers for comparison but just for context i will say that my bmi at the time of all these incidents was around 15 so kind of low not as low as other people s and not that low but medically speaking kind of anyway i went to inpatient recently not by choice but still i think it is important to mention that i have a weird distribution of weight my arms are normal sized at the tops but i have pretty small wrists and i have large thighs i once had a nurse make a comment on my arms remarking on their size and how lucky i was to not have twig arms like some of the other girls same nurse also commented on my clothes wand asked about my size i once heard the guy who weighed us comment on how he would have guessed a weighed more than i do even though we ate the same amount my roommate was threatened with the tube and i never was because of my weight it sucked and made me feel even worse like i did not belong,1,198
commenting on people eating i do not get it why do people feel the need my friend who has a history of bulimia almost every time we eat together says something like wow you are really good at eating or comments on how fast i ate or says she will not eat afterwards surely she should know better or my grandma who complains that i am too thin then says ohh are you really going to eat all that i could never please just stop commenting honestly,1,87
ed is giving my life a purpose and i need to find that somewhere else the eating disorder gives your life a singular focus and purpose it occupies your mind and pushes out other things you have less time for both positive and negative aspects of your life this can be a big problem during recovery once food occupies a smaller and smaller area of your mind the things you have neglected come back in focus this includes positive things you did not have the energy for but also problems and challenges that you have neglected to address for me personally weight body and food gives me something to focus on and become good at once i am good enough at eating sustainably that it becomes a habit there is all this free time and for me a big hole in life so my next recovery goal is finding new obsessions to fill that hole,1,155
not me watching my parents buy fear binge foods after telling myself that i will start restricting again for the 1000th time,1,22

do you all ever get brief moments of sanity i have been living with this for years but lately now that i am in my mid twenties i have been getting this flashes of clarity in which i tell myself this is not sustainable or i am going to pay the consequences of fasting later in life it is so inconsequential because i usually go back to my but i got to look beautiful mentality but even when i am body checking i berate myself with words like you will never be happy even if you are a double zero or you are 4 10 so the sizes are skewed in your favor it is all in your head it is like i am so close to snapping out of it but it is been years of this even more that i have been on a spiral ever since i saw two bad pictures of me it is my own brain telling me that it is dumb but i keep at it,1,172

artificial sweeteners in nearly all of my shop bought safe foods i always assumed that as long as it was not aspartame or some other obvious poison i would be ok but i have been doing research about other sweeteners like sucralose which i thought was harmless slowing down your metabolism by ruining your gut health checked again what sweetener was in my safe energy drink not monster and those flavoured skyr yoghurts plain ones are impossible to find that i have relied on for years and guess what both loaded with sucralose fuck fuck fuck does anyone know how much permanent damage i have done to my metabolism from this kind of losing my mind,1,116
trigger warning numbers my family bullies me for being too skinny but bullies me about the amount of food i eat i used to be very overweight as a kid 96kg being my highest and i have lost half of that weight i have been doing a lot better as i actually eat now but i eat high volumes of safe foods which i am really proud of because my safe foods used to just be like 3 things and now i can actually eat comfortably at family dinners and when we go out with how much the list has grown my family will constantly tell me you do not eat enough you are so boney i am going to order you a burger you cannot wear a skirt because your legs look horrible do you actually think you look good they will constantly tell about how horribly thin i am but whenever i eat i am hit with that is so much food no way she is going to finish that your body is small so you do not need that much food like all i have had is breakfast or it might be the only meal i have had that day it makes me want to restrict out of spite but i know my body needs it when we go to a restaurant they will also hit me with the no way you can finish that and it just makes me feel horrible when i do why are people like this i am a waitress and do a lot of physical work i do not count my calories because whenever i did i would go over my limit and feel bad it just works better for me if i do not know so that it does not bother me at all due to my job i need a lot of food but when i do i get bashed for it vut also get told i am not eating enough they they will force me to weigh myself which i have stopped because i will feel bad and obsess if i am higher than 46kg for some reason so it is better for me to not know i just feel like i am getting better but my family keeps making me wanting to go back to how i was out of spite but i do not want to,1,399
i just need to rant because i hate my body probably super triggering so avoid if easily triggered i want to be so skinny and tiny but weed is making me binge my heart out i am thinking of quiting until i am back into restriction mode i went from being so tiny and x pounds away from my goal weight to being fat as hell and not fitting into my clothes anymore it is so hard to get back in once you are out though i want my flat stomach back and i want to fit into xs clothes again and i want people to call me slightly demeaning names like miss skinny mini again how tf did i end up like this i want to sob,1,128

does anyone else ever go through phases of feeling disconnected from their ed maybe this sounds weird but i am in a really weird headspace and trying to muffle my way through things right now the past week though i have felt very disconnected from my ed like i am still engaging in behaviours and compulsions but i do not feel consumed by them my ed is very routine based i eat pretty much the same foods day in day out at the same times do the same amount of steps in the same way it is all planned and there is no room for chaos this week because christmas i decided no to buy any safe foods i have been off work and had none of my normal routine most days i have spent hanging out with my family or shopping for the most part i have still got my steps in restricted under my normal limit although on very different food and done everything as i normally would today i ended up eating more than i normally would have been comfortable having purely because i am feeling so disconnected from my ed though i feel guilty i feel disgusting and i hate myself yet i also could not get myself to care enough to stop myself from eating as much as i did i am not planning on restricting on christmas or boxing day so maybe i am already in fuck it mode or maybe the anxiety of stupidly leaving myself with no safe foods this whole week on top of knowing i am going to be eating a lot and not able to exercise for a few days is causing this disconnect at this point my ed induced brain fog could be causing it it is just strange i do not feel like myself i look at myself in the mirror and feel like a stranger inhabiting my body something is wrong with my face i am not sure what but it does not look like mine,1,340

everyone is suddenly out to fucking get me it seems my little cousin out of nowhere has started to grab my fucking stomach and also has taken a liking to reminding me that i am not skinny in the harshest ways imaginable unprovoked at that my brother and mom have noticed that i am not eating as much here lately and calls this disorder a little diet they also give me unwanted advice that seems like it comes straight out of a fucking pro ana forum like i am throwing up my food chewing spitting up my food and barely eating anything on most days but i apparently need to fucking cut out even more according to them remove this substitute that blah blah blah to lose more weight even faster like first of all   i was already planning on doing that anyways second of all   shut the fuck up disrespectfully they do not know about the throwing up and chewing spitting but still   wtf,1,165
is anyone else absolutely terrified of telling someone they think they might have ana but not for the typical reasons i am new to reddit and i am kind of terrified to post this but is anyone else scared of telling people not because they might make you eat or whatever but because it might trigger them to develop an ed i just feel like i can never truly know what is going on in someone is life and if they are susceptible to that kind of stuff even if there is no evidence to suggest they have ever struggled with food i started developing my possible ed because i was watching ed videos on youtube to educate myself because one of my friends had ana but then i got too deep into it and started copying behaviours and it spiraled from there anyway i just feel like whoever i speak to they will get ill as well i really hope someone else is experiencing this because i truly feel like there is no one i could talk to about it without being terrified of negatively impacting them even posting this i am worried i am going to make someone else be scared not to tell people around them even though they definitely should and i do not think i should be posting this in case it harms someone,1,229

recovery is possible you all i have spent the last year or so deep in anorexia i was so hungry all the time that nearly all my thoughts were consumed by food and socializing was hard because every time i hung out with my friends i felt like i was just performing a version of myself that was not totally consumed by this disorder i tried to recover more times than i can count but each time i gave in to the extreme hunger it would trigger a relapse and i stopped eating again i finally reached a breaking point a month ago when i went to a party and spent the entire night eating all the food they had put out instead of talking to anyone because i was so hungry the next day i felt disgusting and planned to fast but then i had a moment where i realized that this will be my entire life if i do not do something everything i do will be controlled by food if i do not actively put the work into recovery so instead of fasting i decided to actually start gaining weight i will not go into the gross details of what weight restoration looks like but it involved a lot of peanut butter and a lot of pooping sorry and while i have only been actively recovering for about a month now i just want to put this out there for anyone who feels like their ed is a better alternative to recovery it is not my life is already getting so much better and fuller i am able to spend time with my friends and not constantly think about food i eat when i am hungry and i do not think about food when i am not i do not count calories i do not know how much i weigh and i only exercise now because i enjoy it not because i am trying to burn calories i am trying new things that i could not do before because all that mattered to me was eating as little as possible when you are deep in an ed you do not realize it but it consumes you and you start to think that all you are is your ed i can tell you from the other side that that is not true there is so much more potential in you than letting food control your entire life i promise if you decide to commit to recovery i will not pretend it will be easy actually it will probably be the hardest thing you ever do but it is the only way to get your life back and if you are able to really put the work in i promise it is so so worth it,1,467
at what bmi did people start giving you shit about turning down food i have honestly never been severely underweight or overweight pretty much always within range of a healthy bmi even at my lowest so i have never been side eyed for either refusing food with friends family partners or eating too much of it this is not something i am aiming for by the way just curious about were you always given grief about turning down food or did that only start to happen after you reached a particular bmi,1,92
how do i make myself not like food so much i have not been restricting myself as much and imnscared of how hungry i get i feel like a faker and a monster but i know that is probably not true it kind of feels like i am the only person who likes food so much so i am a gluttonous piece of shit like today at school i ate with my friends and one was complaining about how filling it is but she needs to eat it because her doctor said she should gain weigh and here i am   already ate mine in like 30 seconds it is not hard when you are food obsessed and disgusting like me i guess every time i serve myself food i try to make it as small as possible   because i cannot help but clean every plate i am given and i hate it i wish i knew how to stop being like this,1,162
should i do partial hospitalization i reached out to an ed clinic for an assessment and they suggested 7 days a week for 8 hours which both shocked and scared me when i told my mom she said they are also trying to make a sale and maybe i should do something less to start then if it does not work do what they suggest is that true are they just trying to get a sale,1,76
does starvation from a high weight really because loose skin i have been trying to relapse i know it is unhealthy i do not care i know the risks i do not care and have decided to go with a kawaii aesthetic diet thing i found i was told by someone that at my weight 200 pounds at 5 2 it would ironically be better to try and lose it slowly otherwise i would have loose skin i am only 18 though does this still apply to me will i need to get surgery after the fact i just want to be skinny again,1,104
food waste guilt i have a restrictive ed but i have like an addiction to chewing and spitting along with throwing away food that is perfectly good so i will not eat it and sometimes i feel so guilty i know i am obviously not in a good headspace and sick but it is hard to not get angry at myself in my head i am like maybe if you were just normal you would not be so wasteful it is also not just a waste of food but a waste of money i hate it,1,96
how do you all handle brene brown s takes on food so the only treatment program i have done was php at renfrew where they billed insurance 1k a day to play brene brown tedtalks about vulnerability during group i know this falls under celebrity gossip which is not allowed but i am hoping moderators will allow a discussion because she is so influential for a lot of us in recovery and i am feeling a bit weird about it i generally like everything she has to say but every once in a while on her podcasts and i think in her books as well she will bring up food stuff and honestly it is really sad she talks about needing to do keto because she needs the clear cut rule of in or out she talks about her 3 meals a day as letting the tiger out of the cage 3x day then putting it back in and broadly talks about low carb stuff it just feels strange that someone who is so committed to personal growth in all realms of life and is such a leader would not see this clearly disordered blind spot anyone have thoughts,1,199

i feel like i am recovered from my ed only because i wear red nail polish when i was in recovery i used to tell my doctor nutritionist psychiatrist that i cannot wear red nail polish because it makes my hands look fat he told me that a nail polish cannot make your hands fat and he was right i left recovery after 3 months because i felt like better i did good for 2 months after that i even ate pasta once then i went back to my bullshit i lost weight i am at the same weight even less as when i was recovering i purge restrict i do all of those same kinds of things i used to do but now i wear red nail polish it makes me feel like i am not sick anymore that i am stronger than my mind i still thinks it makes my hands look fat but i do not care it is just that i do not see myself as sick i am actually fat i do not suffering from body dysmorphia i can clearly see how i look what i do is necessary to be at least decent i have to eat less than the others i hate my body but i wear red nail polish sorry for my english,1,221

binging after restricting does anyone else restrict calories for days and then just randomly binge like crazy i am so mad at myself and ashamed,1,25
does anyone else eat while you are sleeping like wake up halfway and start eating and fall back asleep i wonder if this is a eating disorder habit or because we do not allow ourselves to eat while we are awake or in the day time but what happens is that i will sleep and then maybe wake up at around 3am then when i wake up my mind is just fixated on a particular food usually something carb heavy then i will take that food and have a bite fall back asleep wake up take another bite and then fall back asleep until i finish my food then i will fall asleep again i also tend to wake up quite early 6am in hunger and then i must eat like my breakfast then i fall back asleep is this part of disordered eating or an eating disorder habit,1,149

does attention seeking go away when i was in junior high my parents found out about my eating disorder i did not tell them they looked through my phone and found out after i had told a few friends over text they also found out i was depressed and bisexual my parents are conservative christians it was a rough night they were not sure if i was lying for attention and even told me they know i could not have an eating disorder because even though i would not eat much during the day i ate a lot at night red flag binge restrict cycle they sent me to counseling but expressed to the counselor in front of me that they thought i could be everything up for attention one of the hardest things to accept in my ed recovery is that they were not entirely wrong although i really had struggled with food and body image for years and i think i really did have an eating disorder at the time not severe to any degree and probably would have been a faster and easier recovery than it is now i really did tell my friends for attention i also exaggerated some things so i really did make some stuff up however i also think for a junior high kid when there is such a strong stigma and stereotype surrounding what an eating disorder looks like that is not crazy attention seeking behavior i just wanted to feel like my problems were real and people cared about them this comment really affected me growing up and now i constantly have to prove my ed by getting worse so i can recover for real or something i guess i am waiting for a huge movie moment where i hit rock bottom and everyone is concerned and i turn my life around and kiss in the rain or drive through a tunnel or something and everything is okay anyway now i feel like my life revolves around receiving attention and validation from people i have not made anything up or even embellished anything when i share with people since then actually for years i did not open up to anyone because i thought it would make me attention seeking if i liked the validation and love i received in return but it is all i think about now all day i daydream and think about terrible things happening to me or even being hospitalized for the ed and having people pity me visit me and take care of me i absolutely hate this about myself i wish i wanted to be happy and get better but some deranged part of me likes being sick and sad and thinks it makes me special my therapist thinks it is because of a lack of emotional connection to my parents when i was growing up checks out lol my parents were never ever abusive or anything and they tried their best and loved me they just had their own struggles mentally and attachment wise so my emotional needs were rarely met anyway my question is can it go away with therapy putting in the works meds etc will i ever want to be happy more than i want to receive attention i have accepted that this is not an inherently bad thing most people want and like attention everyone deserves to be cared about and loved but i know this is not going to fulfill me and i will be so much more content if i can get myself to want to try if you read this whole thing thank you sm you are the best love,1,613

does anyone else have safe foods that are environmentally bad i have a limited amount of foods that i eat due to sensory issues and for the obvious ed reasons the problem is that these foods are made by really bad companies i try to avoid buying them because of this but then i have nothing to eat other than snacks i end up binging on because i am too hungry should i try to find better safe foods that do not hurt the environment or people as much i feel really bad for supporting the companies even the vegan food i started eating turns out is being made by an unethical company i feel like nothing is safe anymore i know there is no way to fully not impact the environment thanks capitalism but i want to do the least amount of damage that i can,1,147
finally finally told my live in bf of one year about my ed and regretted it immediately told him at the end of the evening told him back story how i was raised and how my first roommate would treat me and speak negatively about my body and how much i ate looking back i was very healthy at the time the ideal weight told him recently he would made some comments similar to what she would been saying to me and that i would felt my ed coming on full force again that i would been having detrimental thought patterns emerging once again and how much it hurt me to hear him say certain things his response was less than pleasurable he stonewalled me and showered and went to bed it took two hours of me speaking at him before he would talk to me after all that he was just upset about assuming my ed meant that i thought he did not love me at this point i am not sure how to feel or what to think i do not know what to respond with i am mostly just apathetic now and exhausted i am not sure what to do anymore he will not look at me will not talk to me i feel like a stranger in my own home any advice is very welcome i am just feeling guilty for upsetting him at this point and like i should not have brought it up in the first day place i know in my heart it is healthy to express yourself but i feel like i should have suffered in silence,1,275
my ed has caused me to regress i have been heavily restricting for about a year it is gotten much worse the past few weeks i now feel mentally like i am back to being 17 which was a very bad year i lived with an incredibly abusive mother and had no control over my life i am 28 and i have not lived with my mother for years but i am suddenly on edge i freak out at the tiniest things i cannot think straight i hate myself it took me so many years to get out of the headspace i was in then but the ed is in control and i cannot see things objectively anymore i am so close to being finished with life i am in outpatient treatment but it is not enough,1,137
post binge self care i have been binging these last few days after low restricting i know my body needs the calories it is just extremely painful i have honestly been crying as pathetic as it sounds i wanted to know what makes other ed peeps feel better after a binge or days of binging i do not want to punish myself anymore i just want to feel better about it,1,71
of herbs and alters is he ok i have just seen that dorian deleted their instagram account does anyone know what happened and if he is safe be well,1,29
this girl cannot stop talking about residential at meal time i am in a virtual outpatient treatment program and all the patients eat lunch on zoom together with dieticians and conversation is encouraged but there is this other patient who will not stop bringing up residential treatment during meals i would not really say it is triggering for me but the way she talks about it sounds like she is reminiscing and making jokes about what it was like for me being in residential treatment was one of the lowest points in my life and i am all for laughing through the pain but i really do not like being reminded of res when i am trying to get through a meal i am okay with talking about hearing about it most other times just not during meals maybe i am just too sensitive but i do not know,1,149
every time i try to up my intake i binge been restricting low like 200 400 a day and feeling awful predictably so the reasonable thing is to increase it right apparently not to me because as soon as i try and eat anything over that limit my brain flips a switch and i start binging my ass off i go from hah i do not even need food i am defying biology right now i am so powerful to fucking hell i ruined it anyways and i am so hungry i feel like i am going to die i then have no choice but to purge and restrict fast even more to make up for it i know this is going to wind up killing me i have done this for 3 months straight my legs are starting to give out and i am terrified of the weakness and malfunction in my body there are some moments at school where i genuinely fear for my life i just cannot reasonably up my intake without binging for some reason if anyone has advice please let me know cus i cannot keep living like this,1,194
i just need to share with someone hi you all i used to lurk on here alll the time a couple years ago when i was balls deep in my ed back in high school i had ednos aka a nasty binge restrict lifestyle anyways i started my freshman year of college in september and i have not made any friends since then i have been incredibly lonely depressed and just have not felt like myself at all i really need to talk to someone so i just decided to vent on here in case anyone would care to read right before i left for school my ex and i broke up because we did not want to do long distance i was so so so heartbroken and absolutely devastated the first month of college i could not eat or sleep at all started drinking and made a fool out of myself i ended up losing a crazy amount of weight without trying this of course triggered a huge relapse that knocked me off my ass i have lost so much weight that my mom is concerned about me and it makes me feel like shit i always thought hitting this lw would make me happy but i have been more depressed than ever i stopped wearing makeup and only wear baggy clothes for some reason i am so ashamed of my body and how bony i am and i feel like everyone can see the sadness seeping off of me because of the weight loss does that even make sense lol lately i have wanted to recover because i also developed a walking addiction that has completely fucked up my knees but i feel like i am in too deep now i do not know what the point of this was at all i am just so lonely and tired,1,311
i am an absolute clown me is a trans girl tries and mostly fails to starve myself to look more feminine gets constantly misgendered anyways probably because of factors i literally have no control over only ever wearing baggy fully concealing clothing and not putting any effort into my appearance because i am not skinny enough shocked  pikachu jpg clearly the solution is more restriction,1,65
my wishes for you in 2021 i hope you get to go on holiday and enjoy foods from all kinds of different cultures without feeling shame or guilt having a little break from all the suffering to completely immerse and relax in this new place i hope you get to enjoy a meal with someone you love without beating yourself up about it afterwards whether it is a fancy dinner or just sitting on a park bench with a friend i hope you get to let go of all the anxieties and just enjoy the banter and conversation i hope you get to feel empowered by exercise not in the way compensating or restriction makes you feel euphoric in that twisted way but just that you can find peace in the fact you just took time to do something for yourself i hope you will have a nice nourishing meal afterwards and bask in it all i hope you get to experience quietness tender moments of catharsis the kind of intimacy you can only give yourself without your brain screaming at you or your body itching wanting to binge i hope you get to enjoy looking at the stars or clouds or maybe just get to read your favorite book whilst leaning against a tree i hope you get to embrace this freedom when it visits you i hope you find someone who understands you completely and whom you trust with your darkness i hope you get to finally speak your truth and let go off the suffering that is been weighing you down i hope you learn something new find something you are completely passionate about something that will make your head stop shouting mean things to you and instead fills it with questions and an eagerness to answer them i hope you will be there for yourself when you most need it i hope you take the first step i hope you recover xxx,1,326
tw romanticising bs so i have recently relapsed after an upwards streak binges weight gain i have forgot how much i love the feeling of hunger that sense that everything is going to be alright superiority complex from denying food feels like no matter what goes wrong in my day i have this feeling to fall back on i cannot even get help for it because i am still in the healthy range not that i want or am ready for help yet anyway,1,84
eds are confusing shoutout to me for sitting on the bathroom floor last night sobbing my eyes out over the fact i had to eat in order to go to bed then tonight eating spoonful after spoonful after spoonful of peanut butter almost a third of the jar recovery is so hard confusing it gets harder harder to rationalize the amount of calories i consume i am not underweight so why the fuck am i doing this fuckingugh,1,78
i fucking hate how competitive eating disorders are but i will win or die trying lmaoooo,1,16
for some reason an influencer friend relapsing into an ed is not all that triggering on its own to me but it is the sudden spike in confidence and outfits of the day  showing their body more nothing wrong with any of these things but sometimes i can just tell the person is more confident in their sick body and those vibes are super triggering i do not know if anyone relates or this is stupid or anything sorry if it is stupid,1,83
your eating disorder is lying to you for clarity i am not in recovery right now but i think this is important just a reminder that your eating disorder is lying to you i ate some food because i was feeling motivated to try and increase my calories to a safer amount and then was convinced i would immediately gained weight impossible i know but my brain does not think that lol i went and weighed myself and lo and behold my weight was the exact same as it was before i would eaten so it was a complete lie and even if i had gained weight it would have been the weight of the food in my body and water weight i know it is hypocritical of me to say this but try not to let the scales have so much control over you your body knows what it is doing edit i am hoping these small break throughs eventually add up to being able really push for recovery 1 shifts are better than none,1,176
i honestly think i could be okay looking if i was skinny or like i think i could look pretty in an interesting way but instead i am a little bit overweight so my fat hanging cheeks make my face look like a freaking square and also my face is so puffy obviously i just want to see if my jawline would be nice under all of that fat well actually looking pretty would also require a symmetrical face that i absolutely do not have and no acne and no dark circles that i absolutely have so maybe i would not look that pretty even if skinny probably will never find out anyways because i binge too often to lose weight some heavier people look so cute with their round and proportionate cute faces but no not me,1,138
my best friend is so skinny but wants to gain weight so my best friend is the same hight as i am and she was always skinny and most of the time she is at the lowest point of healthy weight range or like 2kg underweight she never had an eating disorder her whole family is skinny and they do not have eating disorders as far as i know she always sends me pics wearing like low rise jeans and a crop top and i feel so sad looking at these she says she wants to gain weight and always asks me to encourage her to eat more she also asks me what i am eating so she can eat the same to gain weight i feel so fat when she does that she does not know about my issues with food she just does not have that much of an appetite she is full easily and does not snack very much she just is so stunning and beautiful and she wants to gain weight and also drinks protein shakes additionally i just feel so bad when she says she wants to gain weight to be a little chubbier and i just want to loose weight to look like her she is so petite and small and to me she really has what i consider a perfect body her bones do not show but she is just so skinny so she looks good no matter what she is wearing i want to be as effortlessly skinny and pretty as her she also does not work out or anything and she never had any body issues despite wanting to gain like 5 6 kg which would also not make her fat or chubby or anything just a little more ass and thighs propably i also cannot eat at her house because she adds too much oil and sugar to everything i just wish i had those kind of problems but no matter how much i try to loose weight i just cannot i tried since i was 12 years old i was skinny only once in my life i am not overweight either i am rather midsize but j have such a huge stomach and it bothers me so much i just wish i was born like that but my family eats so much and they are almost all overweight on my dad s side of the family so i guess i just have bad genes and i am going to be fat forever no matter how much i try thanks for listening,1,432
hot take telling me its ok i have belly rolls does not mean jack its not even about having rolls yes i realise it would be physically impossible not to have any i am not fucking braindamaged the point is that the size n number matter someone who is obese is going to literally have less rolls and bigger ones than someone with visible abs so please shut the fuck up i realise this line of thinking is probably pretty abnormal to most people but why speak on it then if you could say nothing,1,95
i wish people treated me before like they do now now people kind of realize something is up and will not force food on me will just accept it when i decline and will let me eat what i want if they had done this before i lost weight i really think i would have a healthy relationship with food now i started restricting my food because i felt like food was always being forced onto me when i was stuffed and could not eat more if i had been allowed to eat less then because i had eaten enough i would not be eating less now just for the sake of it i do not know i am bitter for past me,1,123
recovery application hello everyone i mentioned an application called recovery record to someone today in a comment but i thought it might be nice to make a post about it to inform people it is an ed recovery application that allows you to track your meals thoughts symptoms behaviors and triggers each meal you log asks a series of questions such as did you restrict your intake did you eat alone or with people how were you feeling during this meal snack and so on i have found it helpful just to track my symptoms like to see how often i have been purging or if all my binges have been late at night and such another cool feature is that if you do get professional treatment there is also a partner application for health professionals that allows you to share information from the application with your treatment team check it out if you think it might be helpful,1,159
freaking out because i am not losing weight quickly enough i have top surgery scheduled for the middle of february i have been trying to lose weight for it because the surgeon said the results will be better when i am closer to my gw i lost a bunch in may and june but then i hit a plateau and my weight has not moved since then i am freaking out i will not be able to lose that much weight till then i feel like an absolute failure for wasting so many months please i need some support,1,99
anyone else have a bunch of cute clothes you cannot wait to wear but never feel like wearing covid made it worse because now i have no friends and nowhere to go to that requires a cute outfit sometimes i try on my clothes for fun and imagine wearing them but when i actually think about leaving the house in anything cute i feel like an imposter for some reason i hate feeling like all my clothes are going to waste because i just hide in the same comfy outfits every day,1,92
snacks versus meals does anyone else struggle with eating meals and instead just eats little snacks i will be really hungry and i will go to make myself something that is an actual meal but i cannot bring myself to do it and instead i will just eat like a snack or something small as long as it is within my budget i do not feel bad but i could eat a whole meal that is also in my budget but i would feel guilty about it am i alone here,1,91
is recovery easier if you are close to gw i have heard all the ugw will not make you happy you will not actually stop at ugw but like now that i am closer to my current gw i genuinely feel like i would be fine with just maintaining once i reach ugw or even before that if i feel skinny enough it feels like if i at least go from above to below average weight i might actually have a real chance at attempting recovery does recovery actually get easier after losing some pounds or is it a sisyphus situation where your ugw gets lower as your cw does,1,110
after struggling with and recovering from your eating disorder do you find yourself in shock every now and then by how much you can eat and maintain your weight after struggling with an eating disorder for so long recovering to my set weight and maintaining it sometimes i am surprised by how much i can eat while still maintaining my set weight struggling with an eating disorder really warped my perspective on food weight and calories which has stayed with me even after i recovered i keep these thoughts to myself though because i can sense others find it annoying and repetitive,1,102
if any what are your food rules surrounding certain utensils and dishes you use for me i always have to use a certain spoon for a certain thing like the spoon i use for cereal cannot be the same i use for snacks etc also whenever i have canned soup i have to pour it into my last of us mug and drink out of it or use a spoon i also refuse to use plastic or paper plates unless it is a certain kind of meal or if we are on vacation last one i always have to use chopsticks to eat cooked vegetables,1,105
how do you all keep from losing muscle mass,1,9
feeling like an ed failure triggered by ed recovery advocates i get so triggered envious of all the borderline emaciated sickly thin girls on ig who proclaim they are in ed recovery but it is apparent they just put out that vibe while they keep their stick thin frame that is not how recovery or life is for the majority of folks with ed it used to be an easy task for me to lose weight when i was in my teens i easily and rapidly got down to an anorexic weight it is not that i want to be anorexic now but now with all my thyroid and hormonal and auto immune issues it is legit impossible for me to get that thin again i do not think it is biologically possible i am trying to reverse diet and heal my metabolism and reach my body composition goals because that is part of my recovery if i can heal the physical the emotional will follow i already know the why and how is of my ed and when it developed over a decade ago but now it is different i am 30 now and i feel like no matter what i do i cannot get my body to be thin like that it is discouraging and upsetting and i know i need to give myself more self compassion since i am navigating through health issues and doing my best to heal my thyroid and metabolism it just triggers the fuck out of me when i see all these ed recovery influencers and all the food they eat while they stay emaciated and it is so hard for them to gain weight like how is that even possible how do folks with anorexia not get metabolic damage how is it so fuckkng hard for me to lose even 4 pounds and there is girls who cannot gain weight it just triggers me so much and here i am eating clean orthorexic can barely digest food and gain weight from salad it is like i cannot even succeed at losing weight and having an ed is completely useless and meaningless at this point but what i do know is that i am not happy at this weight and i am putting my energy into changing that in a more healthy way this time,1,392
does anyone else get extremely triggered by supportive comments from friends my best friend who knows about my ed just texted me that he ia so proud to see me eat so often lately i know he means this in the sweetest most innocent and supportive way ever but my ed brain had to turn it into he is definitely calling you fat and disgusting right now you are so gross for eating in front of your friends god this disorder is frying my brain,1,85
i am never binging again and other lies i tell myself every night,1,13
this is just so completely unfair i literally love food so much like it just makes me so happy when i finally get to eat a little why could not i see how good it is before this all started why does this have to happen to me someone who actively limits herself from food i think a lot of people with eating disorders have a similar thing and it is just so unfair,1,74
i think i am going to recover fuck if i recover too easily i was faking it in the first place fuck the fear i am done with this bullshit i want to eat those chocolate mushroom things,1,38
how should i feel possible trigger warning i just got off work and my mom wanted to go to the store with me so i said yes but was in my work clothes a thing to know is 1 my clothes are worn in so they are already a bit baggy 2 i have lost weight so they became even baggier but when i got out of the car my mom looked at me and said you are getting to skinny you have no butt now it is just flat and it hurt me a bit but prided me with joy that it was noticeable i just told her off about how they are really worn in now but i hate that it honestly made me feel good like this should not make me feel good at all wtf also if this is not allowed just tell me and i will just to be sure,1,155
one thing that really hurts my ed is getting food on my clothes i cannot explain it and i will not but any time i get sauce or a crumb on me i just feel so gross and let down,1,40
anybody here with sensory issues just going to add a trigger warning here for discussion of food lmk if i should be more specific so i have adhd possibly am on the spectrum my entire life i have had a very limited diet since i just cannot stand a lot of food based off of taste smell or texture alone i feel like some of my ed habits stem from this since if there is a food i hate being served i will not eat it or anything else as sometimes even the smell is enough to put me off something i am also super weird about cutlery and dishes using other people s things is a no go for me so i will either bring my own food dishes or not eat what is being served i feel weird since my ed does not really follow what is healthy or a calorie count but rather what i can stand to even put in my mouth from a sensory level not sure if this makes sense at all but i would love to know if anyone here can relate,1,189
i am body checking everybody and i hate it that is it that is the post also including counting the calories in their meal,1,24
umm so it is my birthday tw depression suicidal thoughts sorry this may be kind of depressing or tmi but i am terrified to be 20 i always dread my birthday because it is like a reminder of all i have not accomplished in my xx years on earth i have also grown up never believing i would live this long so i struggle to make plans for the future i think the suicidal thoughts are just a way for me to avoid having to think about make decisions about the future the ed is also a way to avoid thinking about the future but on my birthday all i can think about is how the future is unavoidable and i cannot slow it down i honestly do not even think i am afraid of eating normally or gaining weight but rather that doing those things is going to make me live i feel like i need to find a reason to live before i can ever recover all of my friends are graduating college next year and i feel so inadequate i have gone to college or gotten a job i have been alive for 20 years and the only thing i have to show for it is crippling depression anxiety and an ed i feel like this is the time in my life where i am supposed to be having the most fun but i have been suicidal anxious for so long that i have forgotten how to have fun i do not even know how to begin enjoying life again and i am not sure i want to because that means i will have to confront my fears about the future i could go on and on about all of the thoughts running through my head but i do not think anyone cares lol what is supposed to be a day of celebration always turns into a day where all of my anxieties and depressive thoughts bounce around in my head i feel like i am not allowed to be sad on my birthday because i should be grateful for even being alive can i just be sad and that be ok does anyone else really hate their birthday tldr it is my 20th birthday and i am sad laughing out loud,1,385
wish i could fully enjoy christmas this year instead of it stressing me tf out and making me feel like shit,1,21

everyone wants to be edgy and it is making me self conscious i feel like i do not stand out i can draw yes and play the guitar but i honestly feel like am stuck in the past my taste in music are all rock and alt metal from 2000 s to the 90 s and it does not really make me feel unique it is just my style but seeing as my friends and classmates getting more into rap and edm it is hard for me to feel like i fit in the i do not feel like i stand out is because of all the others copying a style and if i do that i would be just another quirky kid who is in a cringey phase many of my friends say that i look good in grunge style and i kind of agree but it is hard for me to continue that if i cannot even stand out from all the edgy people who wore crosses and wallet chains and do tiktoks really feels like i do not fit in in all categories am scared that people might confuse me with a clout chaser or a fucking tiktok e boy goddamn i hate my life,0,208

shopping is awful finally was allowed to go out to london a place other than trees and forests i have only been on picnics for 5 months and i have to say shopping is terrible before you walk in there is these large bouncer looking type men at every entrance staring at you while you walk in and it makes it uncomfortable from the beginning then the shop employees follow you around and keep and eye on you also very uncomfortable you cannot actually touch any beauty products like perfume etc why would i go shopping if i cannot touch or try anything on i had the same experience at every other shop and combined with not being able to breathe under a mask it was not a pleasant experience i do not think i want to go back to shopping ever again if that is how uncomfortable it is going to be i think corona is completely going to wipe out all these types of business and stores the future will be completely online and social distanced and it is scary anyways i do not think anyone would care enough to read about what i did today but if you did what do you think the future will look like,0,211

i want to cry god fucking damnit i want to cry growing up being ridiculed for crying being bullied for it i have stopped i do not know exactly when it stopped but i just did not cry anymore maybe it is because i do not have an outlet to confide in maybe i just need someone to talk to but guess what i cannot i cannot talk about my problems to someone i know what if they think i am pathetic what if they think i am weird what if they think i am weak i do not want to be seen as such so i have refrained but it is been so fucking long since i have cried my heart out my heart has cracked but nothing is escaping i constantly feel sad on the verge of a breakdown but just when i think it is finally going to happen i am finally going to release my pent up stress and feelings i stop myself i have not been able to go on and cry get emotional get real i am so fucking done with this i do not trust anyone enough to talk to them i have people i know i can trust but for some reason i do not trust them maybe it is because i know that at any moment they can betray me reveal all of my problems to someone i do not even know point is crying is important if you ever start crying cry your fucking heart out trust me you will need it,0,262
i am convinced my math teacher hates me i have been struggling with math and it is tough for me my teacher knows that but still gets mad when i cannot get the answer to a question and embarrass me in the middle of class then there are my grades i had a c in math and progress reports where going out you only get one if you have a d grade or lower but my teacher gave one to me and ingot in trouble because my parents expect at least a b then last week we had a test i was getting my grades up i was almost to a b but then i notice i see a day later my grade went down by almost 30 points and i thought i did well i knew for a fact i passed that test i double checked my answers triple checked i had to have at least got most right but then i see i have an f now the test was not even 30 points now i am screwed the quarters almost over and the home work which is most of our grade is only worth one point if my teacher grades it sometimes he forgets so it is pretty much impossible to get your grade up and his response to asking about my grade is do your work pretending i do not turn in all of my work on time i am so stressed out 8th grade sucks i hate it everyone is mean and distant the more i grow up and my grades cannot stay up i am going to fucking implode,0,275

here is my debate for why violent video games reduce violence in real life i am having a debate competition and the motion is this house believes that violent video games lead to violent acts in young audiences so o figured this would be of some help against the banvideogames subreddit it is not too good right now most of the time we commit violent acts because we are angry or frustrated by commiting violent acts in the game we vent these emotions out in the game instead of in the real world say for example doom you know the drill we all like bfg division you might say that video games can culture some really toxic people but speaking into a mic and speaking to a face are two different things i have friends that literally gang up on me and ban me from their minecraft server because they were in a bad mood the next day i had a few words to say to them and they just stood there and let me run my mouth i just did not feel like letting them have their way so i did a thing that is why i think cyberbullying is not a problem if you know how to treat is properly my own opinion you guys might know something i do not can someone please improve on this and post it elsewhere i am not a good writer i just started out the debate,0,245

do you guys notice how some commercials and shows increased their black cast presence do you notice the increase of black people in commercials and television just a disclaimer i am african american i am sharing an observation and this is not an invitation for a racist discussion 2020 was a wild year when it came to racial injustice all of these protests and demands for change made me very happy and proud obviously companies see these protests and come out in support and that is fine but some shows and commercials seems like pandering rather than a genuine desire to increase diversity i was watching a paper tower commercial and it was a black animated family i see a lot of new shows adding a number of black people to their cast i see harvard pledging to admit more black students and many other commercials that you would not usually see a black face on this is all great until you realize that a lot of these companies only do this amid a protest that pertains to race i have never seen this rush for diversity when instances are normal normal meaning not a huge public outcry for racial reform maybe i am reading too far into it but it is just what i noticed on television companies putting a black face as the star of their commercial and calling it progress it is upsetting and these companies should have a genuine desire to push for diversity rather than pushing for it when it is convenient to show that you support an agenda,0,264

does anyone else feel like they were neglected by their parents just because you were never a problem child i know this is not really a thing to complain about but i have always wondered if anyone else felt the same i wa thirdborn in my family and homeschooled for the first 10 years my mother had to school my rwo older brothers before i came into the world and this whittled down my mothers patience by the time i was needing to be schooled my mother was already busy enough with my other brothers that she did not have the capacity to give me very much attention by the time i was able to read well on my own my mother would just plop a textbook down in front of me and i would go ahead and study on my own i learned rather quickly that my mother had little patience when i asked for help twice in a row or took too long to figure out easy stuff yelling and occasionally beatings would follow so i stopped asking for help altogether from that point on almost everything i did was on my own i would start to fear help itself so i would kick my rear into overdrive and focus the hell out of my times tables or whatever it was that i was studying just to avoid help altogether it was not just with studying i was for some strange reason really sensetive to yelling and i would prefer a beating rather than a scold on pretty much every occasion because of this i learned cery quickly how to be a good boy in the house not making any trouble whatsoever never causing problems and never having any that i had to ask assistance with i had fun by myself in those times jigsaw puzzles and puzzle books and jacks and whatever other 1 player games i could find i played them keeping all the possible problems i could because to a minimum a decade down the line i am now older and in high school i do exceedingly well in every class and never because a problem for anybody i do find myself without a social life which i considered to be a waste of energy at the time i have also noticed that all my exceptional achievements are going pretty much unseen by my parents i believe that they just got used to how i was never a problen and now its standard in their eyes i grew up always being great and pushing into greatness even further is exceedingly difficult now i am 19 and i feel in sort of trapped in this image i created for my parents that i must always be perfect and never because a problem i have worked so hard to keep this image but i feel like its tearing me down i feel really down all the time now i just feel so unmotivated and unhappy the good boy in me says to ignore all that emotional bs and just keep moving along but its harder and harder to do that every passing day i just feel depressed i hide it all from my parents because this would be an issue that i would be putting onto them sorry mom but your 3rd child has a problem also i do not even know if they will care and looking back on this whole situation i feel like i have only myself to blame i feel like i was the one who caused my parents to not care about me because i never wanted them to care about me and i avoided it whereever i could i am the one who caused them to look at me the way they do does anyone else feel the same,0,638

i cannot upload an image so i cannot explain how much i hate youtube s new like dislike and reply symbols on the comments with a meme so i will use a rant seriously the old ones were incredibly iconic and pleasing to look at as well as the nice blue differing much from the white and the black so you could easily see which comments you have liked and disliked but nobody does that but now they look super sharp and cramped and generally unpleasant for the eyes as well as that they also turn white black if you use light mode i am guessing you now have to look at them for a second to see if you have already liked or disliked the comment how does nobody else know about this,0,134
despite what we will tell you californians do have an accent mine is basically standard american but that is cuz i was basically forced into a standard american accent cuz my family would correct me if i spoke in anything but that so my accent is distinct from most people around me although that is relatively common but most peoples accent where i live sounds like if a norcal accent had a slight southern drawl and had the speed and stressing of a valley gurl accent it is bazaar and so easy to understand although the people that stray more towards the valley gurl side are a bit harder to understand i do still have a central california accent but it is not nearly as thick as most people s they did not completely beat not literally it out of me,0,141

i hate the reddit hivemind if your opinion differs even slightly from the generally leftist points of view on most subs then you get so so much hate harsh personal insults from people who claim that they are fighting against bullying the hypocrisy calling your opinion not real and bullshit while flaunting their own keep in mind i said nothing sexist or racist just appropriately shared my opinion on a sub i knew it would get hate but how could i know that full grown adults would act so immature and attack someone for having a different opinion i am not right wing in any way but i can see how people can turn into bitter far right racists with equally terrible views from this i hate people who claim to have an open mind but have no room accepting that people with different opinions exist my comment on niceguys may have been unpopular and i am not offended by what people say just shocked that grown adults can be such shitty people hiding behind a screen i pray to a god if one exists that i never become as bitter and close minded as they are you can check my post history for yourself and see if you think my opinion was worth me being called many names by people almost three times my age i also inboxed a redditor to explain my point of view but somehow she claimed it was inappropriate and sexual like wtf anyways that is my rant basic i hate the haters rant,0,259

my mom is a shopaholic and i am so over it i did not know what else to call her besides shopaholic she does not go shopping for random things she buys specific things and her latest kick is starbucks cups i absolutely despise it because she will complain about not having enough money for important things like my braces or food but will then go onto facebook and buy a bunch of cups that are around 100  50 it may be even more than that but that is just what i have seen i have been alive for a phase like that where she would buy leggings from lula roe she only stopped because it turned out to be a pyramid scheme she is also done the same thing other times like buy beanie babies but i was not alive at the time i think she only does it to deal with stress but even if that is the reason she has to find something else to release her stress and it should not be berating me or my sisters either this whole thing just reminds me of how much i dislike my mother because of how horrible she is i would get into it but this post is just mostly about how annoyed i am and stressed out i am that is she is wasting all this money on cups she will never use my family has thought of doing an intervention but we never act on it because we know she will never listen and just pretend to be the victim i hope this phase ends soon so i do not have to hear her complain about not having money but then spend about 1 000 on cups long story short my mom going through phases of buying specific things to release stress while also complaining about having no money,0,313

i think my neighbors were robbed ok here is the story this white van drove by me house at around 5 pm the van looked familiar i then remembered i saw that fan before noon today i was confused at first i thought they were coming home from work but i realized it was going the same direction then it parked by my neighbors house after presumably driving around the block for hours i told my brother and he pointed out that the truck was the cable internet company so they are probably just fixing their stuff but this van had been driving around the neighborhood for hours my brother kept a close eye on them and he said the two people in the van were screaming and flipping each other off unprofessional for someone on the job at one point they split up one took a latter cable not satellite no need for a latter to house a and the other goes to house b across the street without a latter he said the guy at house a was messing with its electrical box then climbed the latter but he could not see what he was doing based on his view then he got down and went across the street to house b with the latter he said they did not have any technical equipment with them either he and i think that two of our neighbor s houses were robbed i told my mother but she did not believe me i just do not understand what cable company and would do two houses at once with a latter and have their employees flip each other off me and my mother made a bet to there is no prize but he still made a bet nonetheless what do you think,0,301

k 2so x l3 37 fan fiction chill i wrote this half jokingly and it is all in good fun no need for pitchforks this takes place a good while after the rise of skywalker and follows the idea that k 2so downloads his memory to the other imperial security droid from hishe k 2so wakes up on a forest surrounded by rusted and mossy debris of what looks like an imperial ship he stood and saw the tip of the old rebel base which has been largely devastated after an attack by the empire he wanders for a bit before finding what looks like a freighter a correlian yt 1300 light freighter what is it doing here he said to himself he stopped before walking any further as he sees that the base is no longer operational and came to two conclusions the empire won and wiped the rebel alliance or an escape was made right after a large battle a large hairy figure spotted him as well as what seemed to be a droid model he is unfamiliar with the figure was carrying a bowcaster and the droid was rolling around as his body was shaped like a ball do not shoot i mean you no harm k 2so shouted i am not part of the empire despite what my appearance would tell you the figure shrieks and k 2so found out that it was a wookie it may be impolite of me but i do not understand shyriiwook he exclaimed in a half joking manner one thing led to another and after a ripped arm caused by a wookie tantrum he was allowed to enter the freighter named the millenium falcon as well as the name of the wookie chewbacca with the rolling droid bb 8 being his translator he found out that they are there to wait for a jedi named rey who went and take a look at the base as a part of learning the jedi s past the other two were quick to accept him as the rebel database mentions a suicide mission including a reprogrammed imperial droid that might or might not survived the battle at scarif everything was going well until the falcon was attacked by a jungle rancor they rushed inside and make quick work with the large beast but with some significant damage to the ship and bb 8 said to him that it would be nice if he would help to fix the ship i no longer have a master might as well made myself useful he replied after a scan it turns out that the navigation computer system was damaged a bit on the attack and he chose to fix that first as it seemed to be the quickest one to repair he soon realized that the navigation system is like nothing he ever seen with some of the most peculiar dialect he is interested in what seemed to be self awareness as he never seen another droid expressed such way of thinking for a navigation system he proceeds to connect the computer to his head using a cable to interact with it in a more face to face way my name is k 2so i just fix the navigation computer and now i am interested in the self awareness of this system he exclaimed to the abyss you you are like me a faint sound of a female is heard i am sorry i do not know what you are talking about and i know the difference between a droid and a navigation system he replied i am l3 37 i am a droid own who was a partner of lando calrissian and had been this ship s navigation computer for most of my existence i am disgusted on how i and droids across the galaxy is treated the voice said and you showed up having the same level of awareness as me she continued i am sorry to inform you but my self awareness comes from the result of my reprogramming and i am sure that you achieved the same thing from a similar method he answers it is not true awareness oh it is awareness alright the way you decided to fix me first without asking the only living thing on this ship the way you decided to plug yourself in without other people telling you to as well as your distinct personality l3 replied that is not true i was taking initiative by my own i see your point he said they chatted for a good while and even went into a heated argument about droid rights but ended up passive aggressivelly agreeing with each other s views hey thanks for fixing me and talking to me it is been a long time since i get to talk to another person she said do not mention it i plug myself into this ship and i have no one to blame but myself for getting berated by another droid he replied shut up she said in a sarcastic tone promise me that you will send my message to droids across the galaxy she continued i do not see how they could have self awareness from your message as the chance of that happening is at most 0 62016 but i will send them to other droids he assured her he unplugged himself from the computer well now i have job to do he said to himself,0,912

okay bois so i need to know if a plan of mine will work so where do i begin from the begining i know but it is kind of a long story so i will try to make it as short as possible so a little while after my ex broke up with me early september i belive i went to a whatssapp group with a friend of mine and met this girl who i fell in love with a few days passed we were dating and it turns out that she talks about some 18 stuff and then my mom who is kind of a little bot too much religious saw one of those conversations about 18 stuff and took away my phne and almost killed me beacuse you know i should not be thining that kind of stuff beacuse i am too young although my ex friends used to talk about 18 stuff everywhere and got nudes out of a girl once also i want to make something clear as a glass block behind another glass block in minecraft i know the risk of online dating beacuse you might not know if behind that screen there is not any beautyfull 14yo girl and there is instead a 36yo guy called chuck who will eventually convince you to meet behind a dumpster at 3 00am so he can kidnap you and eventually sell your kidneys on the dark web buti know perfectly that my gf is really who she says beacuse we sent photos of eachother very often we made phone calls and we even thought of videocalls a few weeks passed after that and i could not do anything and i found an old phone that i had so i installed messenger to it and went with her why beacuse i love her she is the only one that understood me and she never desserted me and she is the only one that supported everything that i do fast forward like two days ago my mom found out that i was still talking with my gf and took my other phone away yes she was still talking about 18 stuff but not that frecuently they even insulted her something that i cannot take they did not even read how she supported me they also saw one time where she told me to love my body i had low self steem and they made fun of it and they will not listen to me when i try to tell them that she is not just a horny teenager and here is where the title runs in my mother told me that i will go to theraphy later this month so i know that they will not listen to me but they will listen a theraphist so when the right moment comes i will talk about how they are basically judge a book by it is cover so they realise that she is not what they think and i do not know if it will work what do you think,0,510

secrets shall be revealed here today people ask how i got so much karma with such a low age account so here is the secret go to pics or politicalhumor and post a picture of a minority eg homeless black mexican making a statement against trump this statement can be on twitter i used this one you cannot use twitter on pics so for this sub you use protest signs or as i used a homeless sign before you do this ensure they cannot check your profile and see you are active on a sub like politicalcompassmemes but if some one notices and comments then just ignore it and do not even defend your self i made this mistake and am now perma banned from pics if you have done all this right then you should have a post in hot with some awards if this does not work the first time repeat until it does because eventually it will you can also use politics and find a headline about something dumb republicans did but this sub has an account age time you may also use blackpeopletwitter and find a black guy making fun of trump this one will also usually work and once you have gotten all that karma and awards you delete that shit so it does not stain your account and you can easily do it again have fun,0,232

regimental schooling this week for me was going great i came home saturday evening after a 5 hour drive south from my home feeling confident after taking my sat i had a somewhat relaxed sunday and finished all the work i had to and prepared for a somewhat busy week however i did not know that monday would be probably the worst monday of my life of course mondays are bad the feeling of going to work to school stating 5 days of lt insert something negative gt however a grade came in for me a 65 on an exam for my ap us history class to give context on this i go to a pretty competitive public highschool and i am currently a junior we had written an in class dbq a special kind of us history essay format as a test finishing our unit and as a kind of prep for the ap exam this year i was kind of cruising at a 89 98 and the next minor assignment would have pushed my grade to a borderline a and i was kind of pumped the grade came in before my period started and i guess you could say i was a little shocked i am not an extremely over performing top 0 1 student but i manage to get good grades as literally everyone else in my class i took to the group chat with everyone in the class from the conversation everyone was getting somewhere in the range 50 75 nobody got over an 85 when class started our fatass of a teacher explained her reasoning behind the grading as she was using the ap grading scale if you are not familiar with the ap grading scale you only need like a 70 raw score in the multiple choice free response essay section etc combined to get a 5 5 on the exam so basically she graded without partial credit no mercy everyone in the class was shocked by everyone i mean everyone even the teacher s kissass pet her justification behind this was it is a realization and a wakeup call to prepare for the ap exam if you got over a 70 you will do great 5 5 on the ap exam if i was this close to a 5 5 why did not i get the 100 100 or even the 80 100 4 5 this was the frustration for many other students the teacher might think our overall grades are amazing but literally nobody else on the planet would consider an 84 reasonable i talked with the boys on the discord vc after school and those in apush said their grades dropped by 5 as did mine now it is barely recoverable and the teacher probably screwed over everyone else and their future gpa s as well everyone i knew to have as in the class pretty much everyone no longer had it not only is this a significant drop in a statistic it is a huge drop in morale huge i worked my ass off so far to have one unfairly graded exam drop it to a grade i have never observed to be so low in my life my grade is so low and it can barely be recovered what is the point of even trying in the class anymore is there a purpose at all in anything if you think that the 84 is actually not bad i respect that but i would also like to reiterate that i live i an extremely competitive stressful area where a s are nearly mandated by parents and colleges tldr the teacher s irreversible and regimental grading policy for this one exam has quite literally screwed over every student in apush this year and everyone is future with a trashy gpa the system is pretty fucked ngl thanks for reading this rant i just had to vent a little,0,657

british school lunches thy nourishment is thy sustenance william shakespeare not only is the food served at my school unhealthy we have to gobble it up so we cannot even digest that junk properly the consumption of dry and greasy wedges is a time consuming process especially if you do not want to get cancer and you meticulously remove the burnt parts furthermore you have to factor in the initial time needed to mentally prepare yourself for what you are about to go through even though i have my meals in monastic silence i am always the last one to finish many a time i arrive at class the following period while still chewing on the other hand my peers have elaborate conversations about whatever newfangled claptrap is currently popular and after five minutes their green plastic trays are already empty i have several hypotheses to explain this phenomenon exercising your jaws during speech increases chewing performance as a result the loud alpha male or female eats their food in the least amount of time the others use their cutlery to pulverise the food and then inhale it when they pause for breath between words they eat so messily that a large proportion of the food ends up somewhere like the ceiling fan the only guy who brings lunch from home and therefore has a different sized portion eats vinegar crisps sandwiched between two slices of white bread a diet which i assume has been developed by a professional to meet his unique nutritional needs last but not least there is an utter lack of hygiene the older generations complain that we have killed the napkin industry but they are the ones who do not provide us with any i hereby assert that eating is just as important as maths or history and therefore a sufficient amount of time has to be allocated to it,0,315

need advise to deal with some piece of shit students from my class first of all we still do online school so no it was not physical bullying or anything like that it was during an online class when i decided to raise my hand and read a paragraph keep in mind we cannot enable cameras afterwards as i started reading it for whatever reason my voice got a little deep this might sound stupid af and it sounded like i started yawing for a second it was not yawing after that i cough a bit and said excuse me and continued reading it around the end i hear a message notification and after i ended the paragraph and i muted my mic i opened my phone and saw the message it was a gif this gif and as you can probably see it is someone getting slap through his phone i ignored it but afterwards someone reacted to it with an emote that is yawing after that i asked my self did they really thought i was yawing you may think this a stupid reason to make a post but the person who reacted to it is one person i trusted also the guy who posted the gif made fun of me before i am really tired of it he is going to the gym so i can talk back or anything or else he is going to beat me up and everyone will support him because he is the popular guy shit like this hurts my feelings and i am a very sensitive person i have all this rage inside of me when stuff like this happens but i cannot talk back i do not have the confidence i am the quiet kid you may say no i am not a school shooter i hate that meme and if i talk back who will support me you may say talk to a teacher   no maybe i am overexaggerating but as i said this not the first time it happened to me not only from that person but some others to but he is the main reason i am tired of this shit school never made me excited for this reason it makes me fucking depressed any advise will help please,0,382

how do you motivate yourself to get back up after some type of disappointment i 18 had this test at school and i had spent days studying for it and i was really hoping to do well in it well it turns out that everything that went wrong went wrong i made countless errors and coming out of the test and hearing the answers my friends got in the test i feel like such a complete dumbass i feel like i have been kicked in the balls and it really hurts it really put me in a really bad and unmotivated mood for the whole day i this legit fear of being looked at as stupid when i know i am not i work hard i am committed and i invest a lot of my time and energy into my academics it just really sucks that this type of thing can happen from time to time and when it does i begin to feel like i am less than or something i have been told in the past by my sister that i should just calm down and stop overreacting but setbacks like this sometimes leave so dejected that i just do not see the pont of putting in the grind anymore i have goals and i know i can achieve them but i just sucks when you look so dumb sometimes i was just wondering if anyone has had this feeling or is it just me needing attention thank you for reading,0,253

last night was a big revelation so i used to really like this girl let us call her sophie and last night i think i never stopped liking her it is been like 3 years i just stopped trying and it happened because i was at a party for my band section and she was there and we were talking just about anything and everything and i just kept getting lost in her eyes and just her being there but for the past few months i have been liking this other girl we will call her them and i have been slowly losing feelings and realizing that she is not worth it so old feelings are resurfacing again and i think i am going to ask sophie out soon because something has to be right for me to fall back in love with her after one conversation right the main reason i have been losing feelings for them is that she is just been dry leaving me on delivered for upwards of 6 hours been distant and just seems uninterested as far as i know she is okay but i do not know if she is worth all the effort i have been giving so yeah last night was a big thing for me and i think it is good,0,220

who is more stupid my brother or me so when we make our cup noodles we always pour random temperature of water in at the drawn line and then we microwave it for 3 minutes and yesterday me and my brother were making our own noodles at the same time so we decided to put them in the microwave together and i said that 3 3 6 so we should set the timer for 6 minutes because it divides the heat or something but he disagreed and said that we should still set the timer for 3 minutes because of a reason i forgot so we agreed to set the timer for 6 minutes but take them out when 3 minutes are left and when 3 minutes were left i took them out and felt them and they were harder than usual he felt them and agreed with me and said to put them in for the remaining 3 minutes but still disagrees with me and thinks that he is right who is more stupid here,0,176

do not mind me just got to vent for a minute even though i am a happily quarantined introvert attending online school 2020 has still been rough as it has for everyone i seriously think this year is cursed i have been insecure lonely depressed and constantly anxious for years now although its all been going quickly downhill recently despite how happy i was to be free from attending in real life school i found myself missing the little social connection affection that i was getting that emptiness and longing has been growing faster and faster i cannot stop thinking about having a loving relationship and every time it pops in my head it eventually leads to thoughts of inadequacy because i feel like i will never have one i cannot stop judging myself for how fucking ugly i am i wish i could just accept it and move on but its always in the back of my mind gnawing at me i do not have any real life friends i have been fighting with my parents more than ever and the only person i really trust anymore is my half sister my only sibling but she is 25 and always busy with her own life so i hardly ever get to speak to her on top of all this my mom is a therapist so i would feel really guilty asking to see a different one if i asked it would probably just lead to a painstaking argument that would leave me in tears again my mind is in a near constant state of turmoil and the only way to cope is to jump from obsession to obsession in order to run away from my thoughts i have no skills talents and nothing seems to make me as happy as it used to i cannot stop noticing flaws with myself i always blame myself for everything and i cannot get rid of this stupid fucking desire for cuddles i have always had trouble expressing myself articulating my thoughts which i believe to be a symptom of high functioning autism but my mom refuses to get me tested so i have trouble opening up to people even when i want to as a result of all of this i feel like i am caving in on myself and i just do not know how much longer i can last if you have made it this far thanks for reading sorry if this all seems incoherent or random i just needed to get this off my shoulders stay healthy stay safe love you all lt 3,0,435

i feel bad for females in todays society these females got these thirsty ass guys and simps all over them the thing that sucks is it makes them think all guys are going to be like that when in fact there is people like me who just want a friend it seems like whenever i get in contact with a girl she thinks i am tryna get some or something when in reality i just want to talk anime and video games edit i am not trying to be quirky or anything like that and i seriously do not understand why me saying female is such a big thing,0,109
one of the most satisfying things is seeing a genuine feminist it is so nice to see a feminist who believes everyone is equal but does not think all men are racists and bad i mean i know there are lots of good feminist but all the ones you see in the front pages of social media seem to be saying that all men are nasty rapists who only think about sex it just annoys me so much when you see the bad feminists that think women are superior like the people on thefairersex i just want to say if you are a person who believes in gender equality which is most people i think you are a good person,0,120

anyone else realize how messed up timmy turner s life was looking back this is quite possibly the saddest show i have ever watched his parents were either gone or not liking him i e their distrust in him when he says vicky is rude to him they also regularly make jokes about how much they dislike having had him his only teacher quite literally was insane not only that this teacher had a profound disliking for timmy he is also bullied in school both by his friends and the person the show actually identifies as a bully lastly the person who does take care of him most of the time vicky is quite possibly a psychopath it gets to the point where he creates a construct in his mind that he has fairies these fairies can solve every problem timmy has it is everything timmy has ever dreamed of sometimes things get so bad they take him to another world that fairy world thing they quite literally blind him from his dark reality as they bring him to another dimension make him a superhero get rid of his bullies give him a girlfriend all the things he could imagine they brought to him did you ever think that maybe the reason he cannot show cosmo and wanda to other people is not because they would be taken away but because they do not exist think about it his parents his teacher everyone constantly gives him weird looks treats him like he is lost it treats him like he is a not all there 5 year old maybe the reason the teacher hates fairies so much is not because he just does not like them but because the fairies timmy is always talking to are the sole reason he does not try in school toward the end of the show his parents get him a dog now if you are the parent to a 13 year old you are not just going to give them a dog that they need to take care of all on their own you would only get them a dog if the child absolutely needs it in timmy s case the dog is likely just a therapy dog who the parents got for timmy thinking it could help him return to reality i am never going to be able to watch another fairly oddparents episode again i tried it earlier i was literally crying 5 minutes in,0,412
the last drop a short story it was a friday afternoon and the sun began to set i had let my lawn mover and leaf blower begin to fully rest i had tended to my lawn after feeling fully accomplished but little did i know there was a urge my body had not abolished while i thought i was given time to relax my bladder had something to extract with the sudden urge to release this fluid i ran to the lavatory with no genders excluded after reaching the bathroom i shut the door behind me i pulled down my pants all the way past my hiney i relieved myself in a clear yellowish like stream so comforting and fresh just like in a midnight s dream as i finished it all up fashionably i went up down left right and diagonally i shook it all off with the thought of it to stop but little did i know it was not the last drop,0,165

anyone who says california should fix its pollution problem clearly does not understand how wind works the midwest needs to fix our problem cuz what happens is a coal power plant or anything else in nebraska or anywhere else west of the mississippi pollutes the air than that air gets blown by wind into one of california s many valleys where it gets trapped thus causing the worst air quality in the country most of our pollution is coming from the midwest not california i am not saying we are devoid of blame but we are the only ones actually trying to do anything about it brought to you by someone who lives in the 4th most polluted city in the country california,0,123

i think my girlfriend s father is forcing her to leave me i am afraid that my girlfriend 14 will leave me m just turned 17 because her father is against the relationship i understand that the age difference is bigger than in an average relationship he thinks that i am only in it for the sex that is not the case though whenever i am with her i feel butterflies and when she smiles at me the world stands still she makes me feel like the happiest guy alive and i genuinely care for her and do not want her to get hurt in any way in case you are wondering she has told me that she feels the same way about me we were texting eachother when she pretty much disappeared for half a hour when she came back she sent a snap of her hand bandaged up she has had self harm issues before just like me a month or so earlier we swore to each other that we will not do it anymore for each other i asked her what happened and she told me a bit unbelievable story then she asked me when she wanted me to lose my virginity to which i replied whenever you feel ready making you do something you are not comfortable with is the last thing i want to do she then asked what if i will not be ready i replied you will know when you are ready then out of nowhere she texted me i know that would be a reason for you to leave me i replied that i would never leave her she started telling me that she would not fulfill my needs and i would need someone else i told her that all i would ever want is just to be with her and that having sex is not the point of the relationship,0,319

ones around 98 we start at 0 we all start at ground zero we all start with one goal one focus one passion someone telling you cannot do it keep quiet and show them you can release the need to live for others expectations and what they want you to do you know what you want to do grind hustle put every living breath into what the fuck you want to do fuck the noise remember just because you are losing at half does not mean you will not win by the end of the game game forever marathon focused remember that we are all on our own highways one lane highway focus on what you love to do amp you only if it is not working for you pivot try something new do not quit do not give up what is the point of that we have 1 life many opportunities many chances so what you failed so what you tried and it did not go the way you wanted so what is that going to stop you better not pick yourself up dust yourself off and let us get to it now i believe in you i believe in trying trying and then after that you got it trying again failures are only failures if there is nothing learned from the situation try again it will all work out stay focused on what you are passionate about put your everything into blood sweat tears pain joy everything get to it the world is counting on you i love you drey lt 3 processing img z3uvlh5sl6c61,0,267

nothing like starting the day with your grandpa trying to hit your mom fuck this fuck it i know he is sick i know he has all sees things that are not there i know all the good things he did but i also know he used to beat his kids even before he became sick i know the things he did to grandma how he keeps trying to have control over her after she died i literally had represeed the memories of him hitting me with a belt for making noise i remember my mom and grandma standing between us and him beating them and am i suppose to forgive me because he bought me a plushie he did good things but the bad things he did are the ones that have not change i was so fucking scare of him and we still have to put of with his shit because no one has the heart to leave him anywhere else and none of my uncles has the gut to take care of him we were having breakfast and he just entered the room calling my mom a bitch a whore telling her she is been sneaking men into our house that she is trying to kill him that she is been stealing from him he tried to hit her to choke her and she says it is alright and that he does that because he is sick as far as i know he is been doing that ever since she was little he is always been that way yet am i suppose to ignore that i am 17 i should not worry about grandpa trying to harm us about hidding all sharp objects and a gun from him about him treathening to kill himself he is the reason my mother almost killed herself when she was my age and honestly i thought about it multiple times because of him i am just so fucking tired everyone thinks we are lying we even showed one of my uncles a video of what he did and he just laughed i am tired of faking being alright just to keep up with his reputation of being a good man am i supposed to lie just because he drove me to school shit what does it matter those are our bodies nobody has slept with anyone and if that was the case so what it does not affect him i am fucking done if anything he is the pervert here i remember how he entered my room when i was little exactly the moment i came out of the bath yet he had the nerve to call a 9 year old a degenarate for being naked dude i was 9 and putting on clothes he is the one who opens the door while i am on the bathroom and nobody in this house is allowed to lock anything he is the one who tried to take a bath with my mom his own fucking daugther he is the one making stories about us being around naked men and so what the hell i should not be afraid of him watching me as i sleep i should not be afraid of him entering my room at night and doing something to me i am tired of this shit,0,556

flash archive porn review you may have saw my post a little earlier but here is some background if you have not earlier today i downloaded flashpoint because adobe flash is shutting down later this year and i wanted a chance to revisit all the flash games i played as a kid turns out that while it does have what i wanted there is a little more on top flash porn most of these are games games in quotations because really they are just animations that i can control the speed of one thing i noticed right away is that the majority of it was furry porn if you are not into that then flashpoint might not be the best place to look for fap material i would have to guess about 65 of the porn is actually yiff like i said not everyone is into that and you might want to avoid that and that brings me to the next point and that is the lack of previews the only thing you see is the title and site the animation was hosted on no tags or thumbnails included this means that picking something to jerk off to is purely a guess but it is also more rewarding to find something good because of said guesswork however most of what is not furry shit is low quality which is understandable considering that most flash content was produced in the 2000 s with all that said i did end up finding something to nut to and yes it was yiff not afraid to admit that overall i would give using flashpoint a 6 10 as a source of fap material it is not practical for your everyday fap but if you are looking to spice things up and suprise yourself a little it is worth checking out,0,306
so guys i screwed up last night and the consequences happened today so this happened last night i was is the mood to pleasure myself but i did not have any lotion near me so i ran to the bathroom to see if there was any and yes there was so i pumped a little bit onto my hand and went back to my bedroom i finished up watched some youtube and went to bed now i wake up this morning with my penis on fire it hurt so bad so i went to the bathroom to take a shower it helped a little bit but not enough to stop the hellfire that was going on i checked the lotion i had used it is face wash lotion for your skin it has hyaluronic which is meant to dry out the skin of course the moron i am used it to to jerk off and now i am paying for my consequences i now have it on ice which is helping enough to where i can type this without issue tl dr i used face wash lotion to jerk off now my penis is on fire,0,196

how i skipped online school and got away with it so where i am from some students including me still have to do online school because there is still a pretty big number of covid 19 cases in my area the thing is at my highschool we are still forced to do every class we did when we were going to school including p e even though some of us barely have the room to do it i am really bad at p e and today we had to do push ups and i cannot do push ups to save my life so i decided that i would not go to p e class today now if i simply did not join the online meeting i would get in trouble so i needed to come up with an excuse i could not just come out with a simple one like i was sick or i needed to go to the dentist because this was not the first time i did not join a p e meeting and the professor would figure out i am bs ing so i needed to come up with a plan i wear braces and i go to the dentist at least once a month for a monthly check and everytime i go they give me a little ticket with the date of the next appointment for exemple in january they gave me a ticket saying 23 february 14 15  i live in europe and guess what i thought of if only i could write over that 23 a 17 without my p e teacher realising that i wrote over it go to the dentist give a photo of me at the dentist and a photo with the little falsified locket to the teacher so that i have proof that i really went to the dentist i could get away with it so that is exactly what i did i wrote 17 over 23 it was not perfect but it did not needed to be i changed washed my teeth so that i would really feel in character and went to the dentist now i did not go in the dentist s cabinet that would have been too much but i went outside of it and photographed it i also photographed the ticket but i left a little bit of it outside the photo mostly the part where it said 17 because i figured if the teacher saw that i went to the dentist and saw the ticket he would not ask why a little part of the ticket was missing i already went too far if he was not already satisfied with this then i do not know what i could have gone and then i went back home ironically on my way back home i ran into another classmate who also missed p e because she went to the dentist but she was telling the truth i showed her my little trick and she could not believe that i went that far just to miss p e the teacher did not respond to my message and the 2 photos but he also did not respond to the message of my other classmate saying she went to the dentist so that means that he believes me or at least that now both of us are in the same boat in conclusion i do not really recommend doing what i did but i am very socially anxious and i do not like people watching me doing things that i am horrible at like pushups at all i feel like everyone is looking at me even though i am sure most of them are also having a lot of trouble with it too but chaotic good does what chaotic good does and here i am if you want proof i can give a link with the images,0,650

hot take on reddit not all conservatives are racist transphobic idiots and most of them want to quit hate speech just as much as you do i am not into politics that much but i am tired of seeing some degenerate on reddit and in the comments it is just people bashing the right wing for no reason why are we honing in on politics here why do not we unite on hating this person s views instead of dividing ourselves over our own why cannot we agree that some things should be universally hated regardless of political affiliation,0,99

i am not depressed because of videogames mom and dad i am depressed because you take away all my electronics and then act like the victims when i actively express myself and give you solutions other than isolating me from my friends and family just kidding i am not an adult so my opinion is irrelevant and i am supposed to respect you in order to earn social interactions with people who actually listen to me and what i have to say i totally agree with literally cutting me off from the internet to do 30 minutes of chores and then sit around doing nothing what is that all i do is sit on my ass all day wonder who is genius idea that was if you have a problem with me why did you have me in the first place you cannot blame me for being the way i am if all you do is use me to do things you can easily do on your own is it really that hard to wash your one plate after eating a sandwich are you and dad required by law to leave the entire sink full of dishes in the 8 hours of sleep that i get but yeah sure scold me and ban me that will definitely improve my attitude sound logic i literally get not even 2 full months of time off from school and i do not even get to spend 3 weeks actually relaxing and blowing off some steam i have to express my feelings to strangers on the internet at 5am because you do not listen to or respect my feelings or opinions thank you for coming to my tedtalk kind stranger,0,286

i really fucking hate my class 9th grade by the way i have never really liked them that much but i could hang out with them and all but now it is just too much the amount of casual racism and other shitty stuff is being said not only to me i do not really care that much because i do not care about them to be honest i am biracial by the way so apparently that makes me black or something according to them but to anyone that is not native to the country immigrant and the n word and all sorts of other racial slurs are being said regularly and it is starting to piss me off i am a non confrontational person so i just keep quiet but god i am dying inside whenever the hell they open their mouths they have to make mean comments and make fun of people s appearances all the time in real life and even just watching someone in a movie or a documentary stop and be respectful for gods sake they disrespect teachers do not respect their privacy searching through my teachers google search history on his personal pc while he was not around make fun of muslim teachers for their religion and of course racial slurs never to their face of course because they do not want to get in trouble they disrupt the class all the time 2 girls laugh every 30 seconds almost and it is distracting and annoying one boy has the mentality of a 7 year old they got to make fun of accents make fun of movements make fun of clothing make fun of what music people listen to make fun of people s jobs make fun of people s education make fun of what phone you have and all sorts of other bullshit that literally does not fucking matter but they take time out of their day to make fun of the smallest things and it is so stupid mean and pointless that it actually makes me angry to the point of me writing this to let out my anger because like i said before i never speak my mind they even made fun of people with conditions like down syndrome because they look funny keep in mind these people are 14 16 years old and it is unbelievable how fucking immature they are at that age,0,404

is friendship just not for me couple months ago my best friend left me i do not have many friends so she was quite important to me and so her leaving was painful because she was such a large part of my life now i do not know what to do with myself however this has got me thinking this is not the first time something like this has happened it is happened twice before in almost the exact way i get to know someone we get extremely close and mean a lot to each other then out of nowhere everything starts to go downhill and they lose interest in me or something and leave i do not know what it is specifically because they never tell me this is the 3rd time it is happened in a row so i am starting to see a pattern here that leads me to believe i am not cut out for relationships with other people probably my fault maybe i am too emotionally immature or i am far too boring once you get to know me no idea so i guess at least for now i need to just be by myself until i know how to keep friends,0,207

a substitute teacher s view on false accusations first off i am 27 so i am definitely outside the intended audience here but a thread from this sub came up on all of someone very upset that their favorite teacher and mentor was getting fired unfairly i wanted to chime in with some thoughts from my perspective as someone who is had the pleasure of substitute teaching over the course of a couple years in a bunch of different schools in california i have certainly encountered students behaving extremely inappropriately and i have even had a troubled student or two joke about reporting me for things they made up it is on a personal level really icky and kind of scary but you put on your blank face remind them to focus on that math problem and move on educators have a lot on their side often too much so staff is pretty fundamentally almost always going to side with teachers over students it is not easy at all to get a teacher fired or even to get a school to stop bringing in a particularly bad substitute furthermore educators have it drilled into them how to behave appropriately with students which includes keeping things public and keeping contact with students outside of school limited and professional this is for the safety and wellbeing of everyone and as long as a teacher is following standard practices and not straying off the path it is very unlikely for any sort of false accusations to get them fired if a teacher is getting fired there is probably really strong evidence of utterly unacceptable behavior and it is also likely a pattern of behavior anything less and the default attitude of many people is that the person saying something is lying in any case where the facts are in doubt well schools have a lot of reasons to prefer sweeping things under the rug a fired teacher is a big deal it makes waves a broken hearted or troubled student being lectured to stop lying just being ignored or patronized or being sent off to a different school is all sadly normal if a school is actually taking action on students reports of harassment there is probably a lot more to it than you might think or than what you really have a right to know about i get feeling defensive of favorite teachers i can tell you that teachers appreciate it but that feeling is from your experience with that teacher and other students have their own experiences just as you show different sides of yourself with different people that teacher may behave very differently with someone else if they did do something horribly wrong to someone else well if history class teaches anything it is meant to be that people are complicated and that even national heroes can also do monstrous things part of growing up is coming to terms with those things and not letting them make you suspect the worst of people speaking of which do cabals of students conspire to fabricate evidence and successfully get teachers fired for funsies i expect it is happened cabals of students have literally murdered people but it is not normal it is in fact very rare if a teacher is fired at your school for non budget reasons however great they were to you they very likely stepped way out of line with someone else and if they did that with one kid they probably did it with others who did not say anything as serious as false accusations are and they should never be made real abuse is far more serious in the harm that it does please do not rush to judgement especially not of your peers it is okay to not have a strong opinion on something you have heard about second hand if you have experienced someone behaving inappropriately towards you please tell an adult that you trust and or take a leap of faith on someone who works for your school all education staff are mandated reporters and you will find someone who will be on your side if you open up if you are in california students can file complaints on educator misconduct online here,0,709

my fish died draco a betta fish lived with us for almost 2 years and lived for a total of almost three he never liked to play with toys like most betta fish he only liked other fish we had him alone for a long time and then we got him snails he seemed to swim more and play more after the snails moved in then after the snails died he lived alone for about half a year until last month when we got a catfish he seemed to get along with the catfish but it was not until the catfish died and we got 2 frogs 5 shrimp and a platy that he really started to be truly happy again he would swim and play with the frogs and even move aside to let them eat food he was also friends with the platy they would sleep on a leaf hammock together upon finding draco dead this morning we saw that the frogs were swimming near him and looking at him trying to play with him rip little buddy you will be missed,0,184

my friends think i care about them less hello so i am not a very social person but i managed to have a few friends who are very genuine and supportive however i have the tendency to be distant and apathetic at times which i am working on it is also a very stressful period for me and i do not know what to do lately i have been sensing a change in my own behavior but i do not know what it is so i asked them if i have changed and one of my best friends said i seem to care about them less but they still understand that i am under stress that is when i know i am becoming apathetic again and i am now more paranoid than ever about my actions and i am a little scared now to interact with them because i am afraid my actions will hurt their feelings it feels terrible and it makes me feel the need to rethink all my actions and it makes me so anxious it feels as if i need to keep myself under check all the time and i do not like it how do i show them that i care and fix that tendency to disconnect sometimes because i really love my friends and want to be the best version of me for them cuz they are so dear to me if you could give me some advice i would appreciate it so much thank you,0,252

it is very very interesting when you are only shown one side of a user i will just make it quick recently i had a great conversation with someone on reddit and being curious i looked at their account and they hate conservatives i am a conservative i find stuff like this interesting as it is not just secluded to reddit people put a very large focus on liking certain people for their views and because that is often at the forefront the other side of that person is not shown he did not know i was a conservative and that why it worked so well people can absolutely be civil and get along but once that label is shown we shy away from it and some can hardly believe it it is why my friend group is full of people from the left and right we just get along and do not let that shit get in our way sorry for this post just found it interesting,0,168
my professor is a hypocrite i am still in highschool taking dual credit but i already hate the idea of college professors especially if they are as problematic as mine my teacher pretends to be super liberal but is an older man and says extremely sexist and racist things that genuinely hurt certain students in the class but this is not even my problem my professor just thinks he has so much power over everything he acts like he is this high and mighty ruler and if we break the most minute rule we literally will not pass the class i attend my zoom meetings online every single day and i never miss a class but one day i forgot to do the sign in sheet my teacher refused to count me present despite the fact that i interact with the teacher more than almost any other student my professor constantly mentions plagiarism and how it is wrong which i do agree with but literally every quiz he makes is plagiarized from some quizlet he finds online i am fine with it because it makes studying and cheating on the quizzes the easiest thing ever but that is pretty hypocritical i just really hope that not all professors are like this especially when i can see that he is definitely not even close to the most problematic one,0,228
this just in four new undertale aus now in progress simultaneously i started vgamer1991 studios about four or five years ago when i was attempting to use gamemaker 8 1 yes the windows 8 1 version of the same program initially used to create undertale to take a crack at writing my first original video game the project quickly folded however when i realized a completely original project was too much for me to take on with no experience in programming despite the fact that gamemaker is marketed as being easy to use even with absolutely zero experience the game was gone and all public mention of my studio was quickly wiped off the radar but i kept the dream and the related goals alive in my heart i may or may not revive the original project as there are people out there who would be interested in playing it but it was never meant to be a sort of game that anyone outside of a particular group would get into undertale is for everyone and i have hacked games in the past so i think i am much better off starting at a point that is obviously closer to my comfort zone here however come not one nor two nor three but four new undertale aus one which i am calling frisk s new home was an idea i got fairly early on when i realized i was not quite happy with vanilla undertale another getting revenge together is a customized version of undertale together that has ties with another au i am making the third diana s new home is a further customized version of frisk s new home in which the character looks more like me but this au could also be seen as the prequel to my final au do not let this happen which tells the story of diana the title character of the previous au who ran away from the human world entirely after she came out of an abusive relationship with derek the protagonist antagonistic player character in this au do not let this happen forms the basis for the previous two while frisk s new home was something i thought up separately after deciding to make frisk s new home i always knew i wanted to redo undertale together but my mind had not yet fully formed the idea of do not let this happen once that idea did form however it was only natural that diana s new home was the topping of choice with which to ice the cake after the final piece of the puzzle that has become getting revenge together was in place i will reveal that the title of do not let this happen comes from the fact that derek finds that diana has committed suicide after being relentlessly tormented by the memories of what derek put her through when they were a couple living on the surface similar to how it seems likely chara also committed suicide canonically and it is also a warning to me the au s creator to not let my fellow humans down by committing suicide since i have honestly struggled with depression and suicidal ideation since i was eight years old and it has only gotten worse over the years as within the past decade i was with someone who was not good for me and they put me through things that i then based the early storyline on getting revenge together is based off of a sort of true pacifist run of do not let this happen where diana and her new lover aidan come back to the underground after derek goes there to live in exile when he gets tired of life in the village where he had already been living in exile on the surface are you guys interested i promise to keep you posted on the progress of all projects mentioned in this post,0,657

so guess who just got a breakup well just is an understatement it is been 1 month and 4 days but who is counting he dumped me through text he was talking to my online fried about me and was asked if he still liked me so he said and this is a direct quote used to but now i am bi so i have a different group of people to like five seconds later a screenshot of their conversation was sent to me by him i played dumb at first thinking he meant me to see the i am bi part rather than the used to like her portion i guess i thought he was too good to tell me he was over me so cruelly in the end i gave in and saw what i was meant to see but by then my natural reflexes to hide my emotions had kicked in and i pretended that i did not give a damn but i did and i still do to be honest i cannot quite work out how i feel about this my emotions range from we are mature 13 year old so we can get through this and become stronger together to i know it is weird to be around him but you can still be civilised to go die you fucking bastard who is far too chicken to be worth my time around him i put on a fake front smile laugh act like i do not care but inside it hurts to see him happier without me i guess the fact of life is that i miss him i miss his quirky geeky personality and his obsession with all things medical i miss how he was tried to fit into the crowd and yet managed to be so entirely unique and special i miss the way he would do anything to cheer me up miss his ability to make me laugh in a split second miss how he would make me feel like the only person in the world who mattered i miss our long talks the way i was the first person he approached when faced with any problem and vice versa most of all i miss the trust we had in each other he was my best friend and now barely a proper sentence passes between us each day it is been more than a month since i got dumped and i know i am over him yet i still feel hollow inside like part of me is missing my friends tell me he is not worth it that he is trash and i should move on but i still defend him because we are friends right i do not know if feeling this way is normal and i do not know if what i did in terms of hiding my emotions was right all i know is i want my best friend back but i want him to be happy i do not need him to like me or love me just please treat me as a friend i am sorry to whoever who reads this in new i just felt like typing this out seeking advice or just a listening ear if you read this thanks for hearing me out,0,549

why do people claim they are not sexist but then complain about wap and i am back by belle delphine men have been making songs about their personal sex life for decades why is there so much controversy when women do the same i remember when lily allen made the song it is not fair and it got a lot of controversy for basically being about a guy being selfish when it comes to her own orgasm look at candy shop by 50 cent 50 cent was adored by millions of kids still wrote songs about sex whistle by flo rida if men can do it women can do it no ifs or buts about it,0,116
i do not know if i should rant here or not but fuck it good evening to anyone who is just recently just been fed up with life before i start i just wanted to tell everyone i   m not political but some of my family is and it is annoying and sad to see a rift caused between members due to their political standing well where to start last year was pretty shitty considering a majority of us had to stay inside or did not care and said fuck it but i am writing this today to express some emotions i had bottled up for the past say   i think since march or may of last year but anyways to why were all here i am fucking tired of politics like one one side you have a bunch of bumbling sjw dick heads who think they know how a black person feels because they are great uncle sister on their mom s side has a black friend and they think they are oppressed like their in fucking slavery and on the other hand you have trump supporting circle jerks who think the president is their daddy uwu like bro i am tired of seeing these two fightings i am tired of reading the news and one side is only getting flacked for what they believed in i cannot lie when i say i agree with republicans storming the capital hill american s like those crazy mother fuckers taken a lot of shit from being fucked over and overall 2020 because their private business could not stay alive during this bullshit of a quarantine i do not condone it but no one seems to know if they did not do it for trump they could have avoided legal action and possibly an epstine like death in the future i do not like how people are behaving now too everyone is too much of a follower because they want to be famous people do not do what they love anymore unless they really stick with it some girls got no loyalty anymore it is harder to date for me now even though i am not that bad looking most of the chicks in my dating pool got dicks i begin to realize how unobtainable my old 90 s shitboxes are the big 3 jdm cars everything is over politicized to have people up in arms against their brothers and sisters politicians are not for the people anymore creativity is dead in anything american made i am too early to explore space and too young to experience the prime of car culture i do not think i can continue anymore do not even think i can call this a rant since it does not feel like i was angry typing this in lol but i feel better somewhat,0,476

does anyone else experience this do you ever just have a problem then wonder if you are making it up then get anxiety over lying to yourself then realizing that this cycle is pointless and spiraling is just evidence that you are not faking it then realizing that coming to this realization is like a twisted form of self justification then recognizing it could be impostor syndrome then getting anxiety over the fact that you could be lying to yourself about having impostor syndrome and then once again realizing that this anxiety would not exist if you were lying then tell yourself that this is just a sociopathic attempt to calm your moral subconscious to go through with the lie then convince yourself you have gone through 26 levels of self delusion like a psychopath whilst the original problem lays festering in the back of your mind as you continue to justify your validity in facing the problem as you wage a war with yourself over whether you are being deluded or not or is that just me,0,178

my dad just physically abused me what should i do ok guys this is a long one so please bear with me i am really seeking some helpful information so it would be great if you could stick through till the end it all started when i was lying on my bed tired after i just finished a long science project since i would sat inside all day my mum wanted me to go out for a walk i refused my mum kept trying to wake me up nudging me and eventually trying me lift me up off bed my bed was facing the other side so i could not actually see my mum i sleepily shook my elbow to try and get her hands off me but accidentally notice the emphasis on the word accidentally elbowed her in the nose she let out a little exclamation but it was nothing serious i try to get up and apologise but next thing i know my dad s on top me pinning me to the bed i was quite groggy but nevertheless sound quite calm when i told my father to take his hands off me he flat out said no asking me why i hit mum i tried to tell him it was an accident but kindly told him to take his hands off me first so we could have a proper discussion again he refused by the way he is gotten physical with me in the past and this time i had had enough i told him multiple more times to take his hand off me and after even more refusals from his end i snapped i started screaming help me aaaaaaargh and tried to wrestle out of his control i finally broke free and bolted to the corridor screaming my lungs out he followed quick little side note he is my stepdad not my biological father the next few scenes were a bit of a blur he started physically abusing me hitting me and i used my self defence my mum came out confused as hell she starting screaming for dad to stop and dad pushed her aside he kept trying to get hold of me but i kept escaping finally he started just hitting me hard although he is weak i did not want to hit him back and make the situation even worse so i simply fell to the floor tears streaming down my facing calling for help i said i would call the police my mum spread her arms over my body trying to protect me but my dad shoved her aside and just did not let go of me that was when things got serious he starting shouting like mad calling me names and threatening me with some very dark exclamations he was absolutely furious i cannot even think of a word to describe how angry he was he kept trying to get to me as well as shouting at the top of his voice verbal abuse finally he let go i guess he got tired he is not that fit he said that neither he nor my mum would talk to me unless i wrote them both a written apology he said i could t go anywhere except for school by the way i play tennis guitar and meet with friends sometimes he continued with the threatening remarks one of them i can remember is that if i ever tried to defend myself again he would bash me to a pulp my tennis racquet it was actually a very traumatising experience now my fellow teens i ask you this what next do i call the police one thing i forgot to mention was that when i told him that i would call the police he wanted me to he waved the phone in my face telling me to dial 000 the australian police number why did he do that i know that even if i call the police they will not do anything unfortunately i have zero evidence whatsoever the only witnesses are my family members who do not really count in the case of a legal situation and to top it all off my dad is a very good liar should i just call the kid s helpline instead or does anyone have any solutions whatsoever why is my dad even like this please answer i am really quite emotionally scarred and to all the legends who read till the end thank you help a brother out will not you,0,758

i do not feel like i am boyfriend material let us just open with the cliche as the title says i do not feel like boyfriend material and i think this because i just got out of my first relation and i am back to having to no friends again and during that relationship i had some trouble talking about some small problems we had also i think i am very clingy because i did not like her going around with other boys but since i am a very quiet person i did not say anything about it also i think that when i reach the age to have sex i do not think i can do like dirty talk and stuff maybe this is just something that has been fed to by porn but i do not know since i am only 14 also i am a huge doubter and over thinker because every time my girlfriend acted off my mind would start racing and shit also do not think i can prioritize a girlfriend above my usual activities like gaming consuming content on youtube and school also i am sure that i am not attractive yeah you can say but you had a girlfriend but i have to things against that 1 around a year ago we went on a school trip and on the way back some guys were asking some hot girl who she would date and then they said my name and she just like yelled ewwwww 2 the friends of my ex were ask her all the time how she could like me amp  x200b i will probably add some things later because i really need to some school work now,0,287

a lesson in finances as a teenager my parents took the liberty of teaching me the best way to go about finances while you all are still young this is the perfect time to start working on finances and becoming successful in the future lesson 1 relationships relationships are key in finances if your future spouse does not agree with how you want to live it may be time to consider someone else most divorces happen because of finances and people who do not agree and if you do not agree with your spouse and end up in a divorce they automatically get 50 of the money you have and if you are a male you have to pay child support and you will not be able to live how you want because you will not have money now sometimes you can compromise with your girlfriend but make sure it happens before marriage that is the cutoff that you have lesson 2 investing a lot of you will be starting your jobs real soon here talk to your parents about starting a stocks account for you investing is an amazing way to earn money for the future if you want to learn a bit more about this there are all kinds of youtubers and youtube videos that explain it all this is one of the best ways to get money and set yourself up for the future and paying for those things you want i have met too many people who did not learn about this until their 30 s and 40 s and they regretted it very deeply invest in the stocks remember this is the time to buy while everything is down from covid 19 lesson 3 student loans do not get student loans student loans are a horrible idea they seem great at first but you become a slave to them if you do not pay them off immediately the longer you wait the more expensive they are and the worse life will be for you do not get student loans one way to avoid that is investing like i said earlier make sure to set aside money to invest and you will be able to pay for schooling in the future lesson 4 your future life in the future after college make sure to set aside some money for investments the best way to go about this is saving 150 a month for your investment purposes and put it into your stocks account at first it may be hard but it will set you up for life and by doing this you can become a successful person lesson 5 school make sure to do well in school doing well in school is one of the key components in being successful you do not even have to do super good just try to avoid c s and 100 avoid d s and f s if you can do this future you will be thanking yourself for the work and determination you put into how you wanted to live later in life lesson 6 personal items sometimes you will want to buy something nice for yourself like a nice piece of tech or something do not do this in a few years it will be outdated and it will not be very good anyways so why get a new one now use the money you would use to get that device or electronic and invest it a lot of the stuff i am telling you will mostly revolve around investing in the stock market and trust me you will be grateful in the future that you were able to learn this stuff just remember this is something that most people would regret not learning and if you can discipline yourself now you will be setting yourself up to be successful in the future and you can get the things you enjoy to have you will be able to get those cars you want you will be able to get that nice computer and keep updating it just follow these steps and you can almost guarantee that you will be able to retire and live well,0,697

having a bad education system is not your fault hey i was just hanging out at youtube and i came across this sal khan ted talk well sal is the founder of khan academy and he pretty much said some stuff i believe is the biggest problem on education year after year we accumulate gaps in our learning and at some point it all collapses no one is born a math genius or a great historian but we all can learn these stuff and master it i thought i could never be good at physics because it was such an messy subject turns out i was missing some of the fundamentals and once i learnt these basic stuff i could learn and master physics at a high school level and now i am at college studying a sciences course physics chem math biology computing what i want to show is that you can learn whatever you want you just have to be patient and calmly fix these little gaps,0,169

if you are bored and are looking for a light read check out this book i wrote when i was younger hi everyone when i was younger think preteen age one of my hobbies was writing books based on what was going on in my life recently i have been inspired to look back at my old writing for some reason it is definitely not worthy of publishing but i am curious whether it would have appealed to you when you were around the age of the protagonist 10 12 some things i wrote in this book are extremely unrealistic while others are quite plausible even looking back at it years after i wrote it which makes me curious how it would be received by others here is a synopsis of my book ten year old margaret lorie is your typical preteen girl in many ways she is learning to navigate the transition between being a child and a young adult which naturally involves many changes the story opens as meg must cope with a new addition to the family via the adoption of a little girl named wayne join meg s ups and downs as she navigates the unpredictable world of middle school friendships you will meet nice and mean girls during the journey but beware most girls around this age can be both and of course as the title would suggest meg develops a crush on a boy named max who is actually fourteen years old how will their friendship develop over the course of the story and influence meg and the world around her read max and i to find out,0,274

so i slapped my sister today this is a long post serious i am currently sobbing in my god damn room backstory on me this is how i am trying to defend myself i guess so i did boxing for a couple years which helped with my anger management a bit but due to covid and other issues even before that i have not punched anything properly for 2 years and anger is still building up in me every single day main source of it is my sister multiple times a day i imagine myself just exploding in anger out of nowhere in my room completely trashing it that is the verge i am on constantly i do however have developed a level of self control to not do anything violent this is how i am living right now so what happened was mom said something to me to which i replied full normally to which that bitch of a sister i have started provoking me like nah i will not in that bitchy annoying copy voice they do my sister is 19 so 1 5 years older than me yes it triggered me to which she continued i said i am going to punch her if she continues she did so i got up went over to her and slapped her in the face and went off 2 seconds later she is bombarding over to me grabbing my hair and kicking me yelling at me how dare you slap me you dick how dare you slap your sister mom did not want to intervene i understand i was furious and you know when you hit that point when you do not cry and you are just laughing in agony that was me sister came over again and hit me in the head twice more that was the point when i started crying mom just said to us i do not want to get between you two fight it off but not in here but i was already grabbing my boxing gloves and i was ready to fucking go i told my sister i am going to go over there i am going to she said no you fucking will not because it is my room i said okay then come over here will ya she came at first i was just standing there like you want to go bitch and so i did and i hit her on the arm and legs on one side she went back to her room and i sat down then it was just yelling from my part with pure anger on how much i fucking hate her and i want her dead etc the usual furious mindless stuff this went down in max 4 minutes it was like 20 minutes or so ago my head is starting to hurt not from the punches but from the bawling i have not had a fight with anyone in the past 3 years it kind of felt good to be honest in conclusion my sister had absolutely zero reasons to start provoking me and i told her the consequences and she still ignored it right now she is acting like nothing happened yes i should not have punched her but imagine keeping all your emotions bottled up and then getting that one last drop in the already full cup thanks for reading my rant,0,568

why we need to fix the education system no 1 irrelevant material short version we are taught a lot of useless stuff while a lot of important information is glossed over or ignored long version education is important some information is critical but most information students are fed is outdated obsolete or just straight up irrelevant to educating youth in our technologically integrated society the system as is prioritizes the analysis of information this itself is not the problem rather it is the prioritization of material within individual subjects if you want to look begin by asking yourself in what careers accepting high school diplomas would i need to do know this to save time i will name a few examples cell structures hereditary genetics evolution polynomials synthetic and long division poetic analysis the list goes on there are also things that are not commonly taught but should some examples being how vaccines work how to file financial legal documents and how to tell a tabloid from a serious study or news report,0,173

my friend has worked on a project for over 8 months to help you make friends match up with questions based on age gender interests continent willingness to share pictures or voice calls studying working status and more hello finally something positive that came out of 2020 this project matches people up based on answers to 28 questions basically you choose your answer and also answers from people you would want to talk to thanks to these 28 questions it makes it much quicker to find people that match what your preference is for example you could say you are looking for people from europe who are 16 25 who are willing to do voice calls and they are also studying and have interests in dinosaurs minecraft or biology also quite handy there is a filter to not match with low effort based on word count users what is the final result the algorithm searches over 3500 people everyone is mostly from reddit to find you compatible matches the final result is you usually get around 20 40 matches people that meet the criteria once you have the list you can then send out friend requests to these users or receive requests from them and once either of you have accepted a request you get connected with that person you form a friendship you eventually meet up get married 3 years later you get divorced and fight over the who gets the coffee table with 5 lawyers involved this is what the ui looks like for a match the link is the last tip i can give is to not be shy to send requests to people quite a few people sign up and do not send out any requests people do have the option to hide their profile if they get too many people talking to them so it is safe to assume that if you see their profile they are probably still looking for a friend extra info you can be completely anonymous if you prefer you would need a disposable throwaway method of contact most people get around 20 40 active matches if you get less make sure you have filled out the form correctly if you include people who have not been active in 2 weeks it is 200 you can send 25 outgoing requests per 24h period email notifications about requests friends get sent out every 30 minutes though not everyone added an email matches are done instantly but you still have to wait for the user to accept your friend requests this project is completely non profit and there is no advertising we are looking for help if you want to help and also there is a patreon if you want to support it in that way you finder  of  the  humans runs this project i am helping out with getting more attention a big big thank you to them they have been working on this for more than 8 months now,0,498

i n e e d f o o d our fridge stopped working a while ago so we have basically been using a minifridge and a cooler to store stuff and obviously not a lot of food can fit in there not to mention more than half the space is taken up by condiments and things like that the other half contains literal month old leftovers and random non edible things my sister had concocted like lemon pepper seasoning mixed with pickle juice do not ask i am starvinggggg literally all i have eaten for the past few weeks is an energy drink for breakfast a piece of bread and a portion of the one plate of food my mom brings home every day shared between four kids on top of that i am underweight and short and this really is not helping okay i am done ranting have a great day sorry if i wasted your time people,0,159
i am just going to be honest a lot of girls on this subreddit get offended to easily and are so quick to argue it is not all girls like i am actually done if you say anything negative that they do not like i posted a while ago saying i do not like it when girls when make up then can but it is my preference jesus christ so many people come at you i got called sexist incel so badly like it is so annoying sometimes i was telling this story about how this guy made fun of a girl in school and roasted her like wildin out and every one came at my neck i did not even say the joke i was just telling the story but hella people got mad at me people were calling me an asshole even though the girl was okay with the joke its so annoying if a saying anything and i mean i anything remotely negative about anything a woman supports it is over like how i do not like mia khalifa it is over i got hundreds of downvotes because a woman cannot possibly be wrong even though she lied about a lot it is so annoying i cannot take it anymore some of you guys just love to argue over everything you do not like i am actually tired of it you all need to respect other s opinions just because someone does not agree with you does not make them the asshole incel,0,256

kind of scared that my mouth breathing habit has changed how i look ever since i was small i slept with my mouth open i got braces and they completely fixed my teeth after i got them removed i am happy with my smile and i feel like they kind of changed the shape of my jaw in a good way the thing is that i still sleep with my mouth open even though i do not have breathing problems it is only at night and breathing with my mouth open makes me feel less claustrophobic and it feels better the orthodontist had told me when i first got braces that my mouth shrunk because i slept with my mouth open every time i mention this to people they think it is stupid but you would think a doctor knows what they are talking about they said that the reason my teeth got messed up in the first place is because my tongue was not resting against the top of my mouth when i slept i am seriously considering sleeping with a sleep tape on my mouth now just so maybe my face might look better i have always thought the way my face looks is kind of odd but it seems like a lot of people do not really have a clear idea of how they look at this point i do not know if i am attractive or unattractive but i am willing to sleep with my mouth closed if that will do anything to be honest the idea that maybe the reason i look weird is all because i sleep with my mouth open is kind of scary and hopefully it is not too late to try to fix this this is basically the reason i got braces in the first place i can still see my jawline and i cannot see my gums when i smile overall i do not see too much of the problems that come along with sleeping with your mouth open but maybe that is because i got braces at an early age this ended up being really long and i do not think anyone would read all this oh well,0,369

day seven of posting until a homophobe makes a well conceived argument free of falacies psa homophobia is a term used to describe a mindset in which one acts or reacts adversely to homosexuals or in some cases toward any member of the lgbtq community i have recently seen several occasions where people misuse this term whether it is as joking as its just a home why would i be afraid of it to undeniable homophobes saying and i quote with censoring why would i be afraid of f this is an issue not only because it makes it harder to debate but more importantly it trivializes homophobia in all cases in other news i have given up reading the bible because i have realized arguments based on religion are flawed for reasons i can understand without having read the entire religious works of said religions for example leviticus 20 13 a very commonly used passage to justify homophobia can easily be debated against if the person citing it does not believe cheating on a spouse should be punished by death that is unless they can provide an inherent reason for which they believe the moral and not the punishment feel free to take a swing at this okbuddyhomo is an sub made for the purpose of spreading hate toward the lgbtq community so maybe drop the moderators a report or two if you want that is all from me enjoy the rest of your evening,0,246

friends are cringe too long i did not read my friends keep saying that i am super skinny with small shoulders even though i am bigger i am quite skinny and i promise this is relevant and i am 191 cm tall or 6 3 i used to be insecure about the broadness of my shoulders because a few people said they were narrow and were not broad at all i would rather be my height than be that thin or i am much wider than you are i am quite a wide person we will call these people person a and person b person a is about 5 8 and person b is about 5 7 so i am taller than these 2 people so they keep commenting on my shoulders and how skinny i look and then i saw photos of me standing next to them for reddit this is the only example also i look shorter than i am because of perspective but that does not matter they keep saying they are wider than i am so this post also doubles and seeing if it is just my mind playing tricks on me edit i do not feel that bad about it i just want to nip it in the bud,0,214
i have enjoyed covid 19 and its effects on the world so far i am still in high school and last year due to the virus we did not have to go to school for half a year and i made the most of that summer up until the end i am sad that people are dying but i would rather have it stick around for a while longer its helped the in environment a lot and i find the mask kind of comfortable it is a plus at school because i can sleep in class and the school days are shorter so i get off early i have been a bit sick lately not covid 19 just a cold but i have been off school for a bit so that is been good i do not know i do want the pandemic to end it is just got some benefits all i am saying,0,155

my school system is such bullshit a little while ago i made a post talking about my regional championship match i did not think i made it well i actually did qualify i know exciting guess what my school system chose to do not let players participate in the state tournament why because they are worried that other schools attending state would not have the same covid rules as them by the way my school has one of the worst track records with the handling of covid they just make rules but give no solutions shocking but let us give them the benefit of the doubt maybe they are generally worried about students spreading covid from other parts of the state well that cannot be true because the entire regular was against teams from multiple counties with different rules every single match so they only care now that students have achieved something just so you understand how the rules are my school made my shooting team wear masks while firing yes we were indoors but every shooter was just under 7 feet apart from each other so it was just a rule for the sake of rules even better no other county had this rule so their reasoning is bullshit at worst and incredibly inconsistent at best that is basically their covid motto that and gross mismanagement and incompetence this does not just hurt our county either they let us compete for a slot at state and only made this rule today this means that other students that are allowed to go to state will not go because our player beat them this means that some kid who has worked his entire season for this is being denied entry because another student who worked just as hard was also denied entry i was shooting for about 4 hours a week at minimum for the past 4 6 months trying to be the best i could and i cannot fucking compete what good are sports if the competition is taken away feel free to rant in the comments about your school s dumbass decisions i know that i am not the only one being fucked in the ass by inconsiderate and incompetent r tards who need to resign,0,377

i need some advice i am a high schooler and there is a girl i really like i have not had much experience with girls i have had 2 girlfriends and one of them cheated by the way i am not into sexual relationships i have not liked anyone in a whole year which is not abnormal but it is been awhile nonetheless she does not really talk but she has gotten more comfortable with me we basically have one class together and we talk sometimes i have no way of getting in contact with her outside of school i want to start talking to her one on one but i cannot get to her on social media without outrightly seeking her out and friending her she has no mutual friends either so i cannot just say that it came up in my recommended i get along with her on more obscure topics rather than music or other heavy topics i cannot help but smile when i am around her and i cannot stop thinking about her i feel like a creep when i smile around her i try so hard to not smile but it does not work all the time i have not been quiet in a long time but i feel myself easing back into that because i am semi shy although people laugh at my jokes when i am spastic so i guess maybe i should do that to get her to laugh i have thought about asking for her number but i do not know if that would make things awkward or not in 3 months prom is coming up i did not plan on going unless something changed but i know she is going so this may be my chance i am not a great dancer either i have thought about putting my number in a card for valentine s day because our school let us us by crush soda and send it to someone but i do not know if the school would let me do that can anyone tell me how to go about maybe getting close to her i am willing to give more details but i just did not want to leave a big message thank you in advance,0,379

the loneliness during lockdown has now really gotten to me ever since the lockdown i have been gradually getting more and more detached from reality all the games i play have now become boring and having no contact with my friends really does not help as of writing my sleep schedule has started to make me wake up at night and sleep through the entire day i always drift off at around 3 6 am and then wake up at 3 6pm at the earliest and latest as a result my routine i am trying to get to is ripped apart because of it i have been administered around two sleeping pills every night multiple times but my body quickly adapts to it and puts up a tolerance to the sleeping pills after one or two nights when given a dosage and one of my siblings are convinced i am suffering from insomnia i am convinced it is getting worse by each passing night i can barely be bothered to get myself up from bed now due to lack of motivation i am not good with arts writing or music anymore and the games i once enjoyed playing i have now grown more distant with each passing day losing more motivation by each one i have a feeling that i might lose so much motivation that one day when i go to sleep and wake up i will just go back to sleep again and then the cycle will repeat itself school is not helping either i cannot cope with the online work given especially since i only have one computer that is not used for playing games as a result i have given that up too i just cannot cope with this lockdown any longer and that is coming from a borderline introvert tl dr lockdown sucks signed by an introvert,0,312

any tips from those who have successfully started an online business i recently got the inspiration to start my own business based on boosting players in games i know there are countless websites for this but i have seen almost all the websites for the game i was going to boost and none of them offered what i was planning to offer i started making a website on wix but as soon as i came to the how i would get payed section you have to be 18 i am 15 nearly 16 and apparently you do not need to be 18 to start an online business thing is i cannot find any websites or services that you can make have a website made that does not require you to be 18 not only that but paypal needs you to be 18 too for those of you out there with any business whatsoever that is vaguely similar to mine what did you use to start your business do you have any advice or should i just give up and wait for a few years until i am old enough for all the proper things,0,194

in terms of asking out your crush do it litteraly the worst they can say is no well not exactly but you get the point i asked the girl i like out and guess what we dated for a couple months i did not wait super long to ask her out i jumped on the chance here is another example my buddy and i are at a basketball game performing with the band my friend is a total dork so am i but that is beside the point he decides to ask out literally the hottest cheerleader on the squad she said no but the fact that he had the courage to do it is amazing so i encourage you all if you are on the fence about asking do it before it is to late okay that is all thanks for reading you all,0,145

i was an anti masker and now have covid 19 if you want to see the rainbow you have to put up with the rain wearing a mask and social distancing is a small price to pay for things to go back to normal until a couple of weeks ago i was an anti masker i live in florida and work in a restaurant and it was only until masks became mandatory in my restaurant after months of not wearing one that i came around and understood the importance of wearing a mask my excuses were that it is hot i am constantly running around and wearing a mask i thought would slow me down and make me uncomfortable the funny thing is i would never actually worn a mask before so i had no real knowledge of what wearing it would feel like let me tell you all its not that bad sure you might get a little warmer than you would if you were not wearing it but that is a reasonable price to pay for preserving the safety and lives of others i have taken a complete 180 on this issue and feel guilty for my stance before let me be clear a mask does not make you immune to coronavirus i work in an overcrowded restaurant and even after wearing a mask every second at work i still tested positive for coronavirus a few days ago social interaction is the worst possible thing we could be doing right now and i am quarantined in my house with a lot of things to think about how my comfort used to overrule others safety how i used to hate people pushing for masks how annoying it was and now how important it is if anyone reading this would just take a minute to examine what makes their life more important than anyone else s i think we would have a lot more lives saved a mask does not make you immune but it does help and refusing to wear one going out partying and not social distancing is a selfish and deadly exercise to partake in i wish you all well and urge you to please wear masks as often as you can and only go outside for things that are truly necessary the lives and wellbeing of those around you and yourself are more important than your body temperature,0,402

i am not antivax but i kind of do not trust the new covid vaccine first of all i am not a doctor so what i say maybe just stupid nonsense second of all just to enforce it i am not antivax so the reason i kind of do not trust those covid vaccines are because they are very new and i think vaccines should be researched for a longer time but to be honest the world is kind of desperate so i sorta also understand why it came so fast edit i am actually probably more worried with the side effects not that the doctors are evil or something i trust them again i am not a doctor so i do not know almost no shit about the subject,0,130

why did a guy lied to me about having a girlfriend when he had a crush on me this took place a year ago and i am suddenly remembering it for some reason i had a guy friend who announced to me and our mutual friends that he had a girlfriend i said congrats to him and did not give much thought to it until when he started saying cheesy flirty things to me and initiated to hang out together which i usually respond with do not you have a girlfriend to do that with and sometimes he would tell me that he is going to blah blah place with his girlfriend and even tell me what they would be doing there and i would be like alright that is cool and then this continued along with our daily random conversations until one day he admitted that he has a crush on me and he never had a girlfriend to begin with i told him that i have always seen him as a friend and he said he knows then we drifted and never talked again but now i am just wondering why did he go such lengths to create an imaginary girlfriend when he had a crush on me,0,210
you are in my dreams long before we know ourselves our paths are already set in stone some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will there are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in content with being blinded by rules and judgment we live in a world where it is more okay to follow than to lead in this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to being a leader in this day and age is being a threat not many people stood up against the system we all call life but toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice a voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time a voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest this is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too this is the story of the man on the moon,0,185

not sure what my health teacher expects from my class so i just went into health and started sexual education again because my school has 3 years of middle school and then in the first 3 years of high school just teaches us the same shit again so anyway i am in sexual education and my school is hybrid you could either be at home or at school but right now most of the kids are at home sometimes when my teacher asks a question every once in a while he directs it to only the kids at home and when he does this there is only silence to be honest i am not sure what he expected because right now we are talking about std s and shit like that and i do not think anyone would want to talk about that with their parents probably in the next room also just to be clear i am not annoyed at my teacher because he is not a dick about it and making us talk and is a pretty chill guy i think he is realizing that we do not want to talk about it because he is been asking the at home kids less and less,0,207
i did an experiment with the placebo effect as i was going up to my bedroom my sister took my pillow i have two pillows because hers was uncomfortable now that pillow that she took is extremely comfortable and she felt a lot happier with it she said i took the pillow back and she started to get very grumpy she threw her pillows on the floor and started mumbling some stuff that i could not hear she became extremely upset over the pillow because she is young i thought it would be interesting to do an experiment on her because she does not think a lot she just does stuff i changed the pillow covers so she had my cover and i had hers i then gave it back she seemed delighted and started blabbering about how comfortable it was and how the other pillow hurt her neck whereas this one was perfect she thought that it was the same pillow that she took from me whereas in reality it was the pillow she was complaining about she is happily snoring and i have no intention of ever telling her about it it is very interesting how the brain works,0,201

how is your school handling the virus at my school in malaysia we have temperature checks every morning and we are asked to practice social distancing my principle actually yelled at some of my classmates during one fine recess morning because they did not social distance since my class is one of the first on the block plus my principle has a very very loud voice when she left our class to inspect other classes she could not find anything wrong as everyone heard her and sat down at their tables anyways i hope everyone keeps safe during this pandemic we all can overcome this,0,105
honestly i am not one who usually makes these kinds of post and some of ya ll might disagree so hot take hella rant coming up i do not like to talk about my childhood or my past pretty much because i like to leave it behind me but to give a very vague summary it was not great i grew up without a home had a broken family and struggled quite a bit in school because of that alongside mental illnesses i truly believed from the age of 12 14 that my future was either me becoming some stripper prostitute or being 6 feet under because i saw no options for me and i know someone out there reading this can somewhat relate i know someone out there has a mental illness or life situation that makes it hard to picture a future where your life is not complete shit and none of this is my fault and its not your fault either its just unfortunate life circumstances that put us in these situations that being said and here is the controversial statement i was and still am so sick of people with savior complexes trying to lift their ego s up on saving me when really they do not give a shit this does not apply to people who genuinely love and care for peoples well being like you know yourself and you know when you are being genuine so this post does not apply to you but i have had people use me for their own gain to make themselves look like great people i have had so many friends make public post before saying look at how great of a person i am because i am friends with this girl who went through all of this and i am helping her posting my traumas to stroke their own dicks or even people who i have dated who would make their own statements or brag to their friends about dating someone like me had an exgirlfriend use that exact statement someone like me to everyone in my life who has truly helped me i love you all and you all know who you are but people who have been through it we know when you all are faking it to feel good about yourself we see right through it final note if you are in a shitty situation right now and you see no bright future i have so much faith and belief in you that you can fucking take this head on and win you have a chance and you can win this fight and once you are out of that dark tunnel know that its you who did it you took that challenge head on and came out do not let no bitch try to make some dumbass instagram post saying look at what i did nah bitch you did that if you actually read this entire post by the way know that i love you sm and i know some people are going to be like that is so rude of you to say someone is an asshole for helping you and its hard to explain but what these people are doing is not help they are milking my trauma for them to feel good and it ultimately makes me feel like shit,0,559

a rant about something i would loved but left because of circumstances this is going to be a long rant because nobody in real life really cares at this point i apologise in advance if it upsets anyone or gets too negative i am stuck in a miserable moment right now have you ever had that one thing that you loved but left behind yet still think of every fucking day it would be tennis for me i stopped playing it three three and a half years back and i still miss it every single day i changed academies thrice before ultimately leaving the sport altogether even though i loved it so fucking much and was lost without playing it it started to get associated with unpleasant memories and pathetic conversations and just it was bad i have tried going into another sports like swimming boxing mma but ever have that one thing that ruined you for everything else those sports were great but they could not quite match up to the spot that tennis had and will always have in my heart every time when i score good or win an award or something all of my relatives start asking what i want for a gift that i have to say the name and they will get it and internally i am just like please get me a good coach someone who is not fucking four hours away or cares about how much i weigh or will go to the extent of breaking my racquet because i did not buy one from their relative literally all i want is one coach to actually care about me and my game who does not give a fuck about me being a girl or that i am a kilogram above below what they want me to weigh who is genuinely invested in improving my game i will honestly go to hell and back for them but fuck man just ine nice coach i really cannot blame anyone my family both immediate and extended tried i am very very thankful that they cared enough but the distance was too much to travel in a single day going and returning i still play once every few months usually i am just in my room shadowing movements sometimes i get in these bitter and sad spells but y know shit happens and that is that either way i hope you have a nice day,0,409

hey i just need some help real quick any input would be great so me an oblivious dumbass went 4 months not realizing a girl had liked me well she told be after the school year ended 2 years ago funny thing was the entire time i liked her too well then we ended up having this weird fling thing things got more serious and she kind of just ended it saying she just wants to be friends issue is i never stopped liking her a year after all this we both end up getting into separate relationships and well they both end up ending around the same time funny enough i just want to say the reason i broke up with said girl was not because of original girl well pretty much the entire time we have off and on talked and she came into where i work today and messaged me we talked for hours  issue is i still like her and well my oblivious ass combined with over analyzing has got my head spinning and it has for basically this entire scenario i have no clue what to do i do not think i should mention anything but due to over analyzing i may be reading into some things she said way to much mostly just like i have my reasons but i will not tell you this is when she was saying i am not an asshole do not remember specifics but i think i said i can be a slight assailed from time to time like every other human then near the end something that happened during my big oblivious time was brought up but she kept on saying stuff like i am going to go to sleep so i keep my mouth shut stop talking and it is got me real confused but yeah my main question is just  what should i do i really have no clue and i have insomnia and i am sick now so i already cannot sleep but this whole thing just has my head spinning going over situation over situation thinking i am just some oblivious dumbass  but i am probably just reading into it too much to anyone who helps and is readying this far thank you so much tl dr i am known to be oblivious but i am also analytical and tend to over analyze i have liked this girl for years now and i do not know what to do due to past occurrences,0,420

tables turned 149 when we go through the pain the anxiety the sadness the darkness the depression everything that is constantly pushing us back and trying to push us down one day the tables turn one day we get to the point where all the time energy effort sweat tears blood amp our entire soul is seen by the universe and given to us 100 fold until that day keep pushing keep going its all worth it the times we are going through can be difficult sometimes to find the energy to push through the day to complete tasks and projects that have been created by us but then become a responsibility something that helps me is knowing when i am feeling tired and wanting to give up i take a step back to reset i go outside and breathe in fresh air to forget about life for a brief moment and just be everything that is being focused on right now is for something greater than we can even think of that we expect but the universe already knows and that is all that matters to me keep going i love you drey lt 3,0,196

i thought it was a myth but it worked i have heard a few times from the internet that pirates wore eye patches to switch between light and dark i thought it was clickbait garbage but it actually works i tried it on accident and it was freaking me out so what i did was i was laying on my bed looking at my phone my head was on my pillow and my left eye was completed covered by the pillow so i was only looking with my right eye i was like this for 30 minutes to an hour then i decided to fall asleep so i got up to plug in my phone across the room and turn off the light when i got up my left eye the one that was covered hurt i closed my left eye and had normal vision but i opened my left eye and closed my right everything was way too bright and blurry i just kept my left eye shut until i turned off the light everything was totally dark and i could not see anything but when i opened my left eye my vison got crazy i closed my right eye i could see in the dark when i only had my right eye open i could not see anything at all i was freaking out and was worried i had gone blind in that eye it took over 15 minutes for my right eye to adjust to the dark so that is why pirates used eyepatches i guess if they even did you lose your depth perception but having the superpower to not need candles and to just be able to see in the dark instead might have totally been worth it,0,293

i keep finding myself haunted with increasingly intense feelings of nostalgia i have such good memory that literally almost anything triggers it songs i used to listen to just 3 months ago certain furniture games tvs toys smells tastes pictures dreams nightmares every once in a while i look at different parts of my body and think i am starting to look more and more like an adult i am going to be 16 soon and i can already feel myself grieving as if i am slowly losing myself that is how i feel at least then there is all of my friends on xbox and minecraft i have this world on minecraft i actively used to play on for 3 years and every build is another story about the good times i have had with my friends things i have listened to how i felt and the overall vibe that life gave off during that time and how things slowly just fell apart i have lost the motivation to build there because every time i enter the world its just another i am even nostalgic about the nonstop bullying i went through at school i am nostalgic about the nightmares i have gotten from it i am what is wrong with me it is to the point where i have become obsessive with documenting everything in my life i do not know what to do to stop this right now i am just sitting and staring at random things and thinking about the past what can i do to stop this,0,262

my ancestor created coca cola and he was addicted too coca cola was originally expectorant but some guy tasted it when it was cold and experienced the great mouth orgasm for the first in human history i believe he was my ancestor in his writings he explained it was something earth shattering i could feel my tongue vibrate against my teeth that created a nice sensation my whole throath was orgasming my eyes felt good he and the creator of pepsi together fought against each other in one of his writings he describes a situation where the creator of pepsi kidnapped him tortured him with pepsi and destroyed cola bottles in front of him causing a life long depression which was not curable after what he saw he died when he accidentally drank fanta the doctors said that it tasted so much like shit to him that his heart apparently killed itself it is theorized that he had cola inside his veins not blood i believe this is the case for me too,0,173

my dad is a scumbag a liar and a cheater so let us start from the beginning three years ago my dad picked up a job like 40 minutes from our house it was just a construction job for a lesbian couple he went over there working alot everything was going good and about a year later while he was working over there my mom told me and my brother we are going over there to bring my dad pizza for lunch we got there and the people were really nice and my mom ended up forming a really good friendship with them they also had a pool over there so we would frequently go to their house and swim during summer my mom started noticing my dad was acting really weird with the one girl in the relationship but she did not really want to ask my dad about it because it was not that much of a big deal everything is going good we are having the couple over for dinner at least once a week time jump to summer 2019 we were all over at their house and my dad and the one girl he had been acting strange they say they are going to go to the store to get stuff for dinner everyone says ok and we do not really think about it but they did not leave my brother had went out to the car to get something and accidentally found her giving my dad a blowjob my brother told my mom and my mom confronted my dad about it after we had gotten home he lied and said my brother was lying my mom did not want to argue so she just gave up with asking him questions because he always deflects them jump to november 2019 my mom asks me if i might want to be an actor modeler i said yes and she sends in a picture of me to the place and they basically accepted it i was doing weekly acting classes and my mom was paying 100 every class keep in mind the action agency said that they would fly me and my mom out to los angeles for a big acting convention where i could get signed for different things i did the acting classes every week until january 5th which is when they flew us out to la we did the acting convention and i got signed i was also doing more online acting classes because corona had just started a month later my dad tells my mom he wants a divorce they both call me and my brother out to the living room and my mom is crying and as soon as i saw him standing there i knew what he was going to say he wants a divorce with my mom i ask him why and he just stands there silent with that dumb face you have when you just do not know what else to say we are all sure that as soon as the divorce is settled he is going to hook back up with the one girl few months later my dad says he does not have enough money to keep paying child support my mom asks how because he drained the main bank account when he asked for a divorce as always he deflected the question and put it all on my mom since me and my brother have to go over there every week i decided to take advantage of it my dad had been out getting groceries with my brother he left me at his apartment so i scoured his room to see if i could find any hint of him lying about having no money i found a huge stack of 100s and 20s with well over a thousand dollars in it i also found another stack of cash totaling up to 400 i took pictures of all the money he had and and sent them to my mom asking if this is enough proof for the lawyer now about a month ago my dad said he could keep helping my mom pay the bill s for the house he was making us sell our house i was so mad but i knew i could not do crap against it the only reason he is making my mom sell our house is because he will get half of the money from it my mom is currently trying to find a house for us sorry for the really long post i just had to get it off of my chest,0,771

fuck it i cannot keep it in anymore i am about to vent ok so it start it off we should go a long way back 2002 my father and mother got married a love marriage no it was a forced due to societal pressure ok moving on at 2004 i was born you should know that my father was diagnosed with schizophrenia in late 90s after serious issues my mum divorced him in 2006 and i went with my mum so in 2008 my mum married my stepfather which was a love marriage or so she thought in 2011 she discovered the horrible truth the reason he married or faked love is to use her gold to repay his debts now that his purpose is finished his attitude turned entirely at 2015 she was diagnosed with brain tumor at the time my dad was said to have celebrated this event saying that she would die and he could remarry so the next year at 2016 started my journey downhill my mum took me to court cuz my biological dad filed for child custody i had to spend the second saturday of every month at the country from 2016 2019 which is basically me avoiding him in 2017 during one of these days i went wild he was constantly pestering me to talk with him and he grabbed my wrist hard that i got this sudden urge of anger i pinned him to the ground screaming and bit his hands i remember the taste of blood in my mouth and people tugging me away from him the court ruled me to psychotherapy sessions which was a total scam and the meds totally fucked my sleep cycles forever also during 2017 one day at school i felt a sudden pain in my lower abdomen and was rushed to the hospital where i was diagnosed with stage 1 fatty liver from 2017 onwards my grades went downhill too and in 2018 i was diagnosed with dyscalculia maths dyslexia which explained my struggle in arithematics in 2018 i was sent to live with my grandparents most of the time was used up in trying to keep my grades up in 2019 i was under constant pressure of studies in 2020 i do not know how but i finally passed maths with 40  33 being the minimum to pass so then came the decision which stream to take my weakness in maths meant that i could not go forward with my dream of pursuing computer science there was 3 subjects i was strong at gt english gt social science gt biology my mum told me to take biology but i knew damn well that the supplementary physics and chemistry that is going to come along it is going to be hard as fuck so i told her that i will take social science and then after 18 i will privately pursue computer science but when the time came i was pressurised and i had to take bio homescience which is hard as fuck mum declared that she will ship me off to iraq under labour visa if i do not pass and calls me worthless other than all this there are a lot of internal family issues which is pushing me to the limit whatever i study do not get retained no matter what method i take i feel like everything is futile everyday i wake up to my mum screaming at me saying how useless i am and how she got me sorry for the grammatical errors,0,594

my opinion on reddit i found out about reddit in a pewdiepie video i thought it sounded cool so i downloaded it i had never had social media up until that point so this was an interesting occasion at first i was confused it seemed like you could look up anything and there would be a subreddit on it i thought social media was something is that everyone had to have the same opinion but as time went on it because clear there are many different people on the internet so there needs to be a place where people an opinion can talk to people with the same opinion without being ridiculed by people with different opinions most social media applications only have a like situation but reddit allows you to say hey i do not like that without having to comment under the post in real life i do not have many friends but on reddit social popularity does not matter we are all just a group of outcasts who come together to make a community of wonderful people who can share their things that they would never say in real life do not be afraid to be yourself we are all beautiful in our own way share your opinion and if we get downvoted than we must accept that some people do not have the same ideas as us reddit is wonderful reddit is horrible reddit is diverse thank you for coming to my ted talk,0,248

feel pretty rubbish about myself right now i am pan ace female in a relationship with a straight ace male and my sister is bi in a relationship with a bi male my sister is very loud and proud about her sexuality and lgbt issues whereas her boyfriend and myself are more closeted nothing wrong with either of those but sometimes she likes to throw it in your face a bit and constantly talks about how sexy fit attractive girls are in front of her boyfriend which apparently he feels bad about and i am sure if he was talking about dudes she would be upset she claims to understand lgbt and mental health issues with her activism but if you mention a problem she will often make fun of you make a joke which is not funny basically my town have pride flags up at the moment and i was upset because i had not seen a pan or ace flag yet i saw a nb flag today possibly questioning if i am nb atm but only a few people know and it made me happy we walked past and i said guess the flag and she was like non binary and i was like yeah all excitedly as a joke i pointed out the rainbow flag and asked her to guess because everyone knows that flag and she said stop trying to pretend like you are gayer than me which really hurt i am not as open about my sexuality and i have never been with another gender apart from male so it made me really upset we then walked past a pan flag and i freaked i was so happy because i had not seen one yet and i was saying how cool it was and she was like i would call myself pan but i cannot be arsed like what then went to say how she can label herself what she likes of course she can but it is weird that she would say that as if being pansexual is a bad thing and finally i said now we have to find an asexual flag and she said yeah but remember asexuals do not exist i was like wtf and she said it was a joke not very funny is it see what i mean about showing how she cares for the community but then makes a remark like that it happens constantly especially with my mental health triggers nothing she said today was funny none of it i cannot believe she had the audacity to say that and invalidate both me and my boyfriend on mobile so sorry for the format i kind of need cheering up,0,452

stories of people mistaking me for adults i am quite big even though i am 15 and from behind one could realisticly assume a late 20s early 30s man was standing in front of them this turns out to be really confusing for some people 1 my dad and i were at a department store that was specialised for tech stuff and we were looking for a dongle for my macbook the store we were in was quite small and you had to squeeze between people most of the time this was pre corona as my dad and i were looking around i hear someone asking how much a terabyte cost initially i just assumed a middle age man from his voice was asking an employee even if his question did not exactly make sense hard disk or ssd presumably so i ignored him the guy repeated his question a few times but again i just assumed he was trying to get an employees attention and ignored him now i was wearing a fluorescent shirt mistake the employees also wore flourescent eventually the guy got frustrated and tapped me on my shoulder how much does a terabyte cost oh i do not work here i say revealing my baby face the confused look on the guys face was a sight to behold and he apologised for being rude we still laugh at this instance today even though its been a few months never saw the guy again tldr someone thought i was a store employee i was not 2 my family were at a school function for my brother and at the end everyone went to dinner together for some context my hypersocial mom is friends with most of the parents and teachers present or should i say all of them the dinner starts it was all you can eat and some of the parents start walking around offering wine to other parents its kind of their thing they drink a lot of course they are not exactly daft enough to offer alcohol to the students eventually they come round to our table and someone taps my shoulder quite obviously talking to me would you like some wine i look around and the parent behind me burst out laughing they thought i was my dad in this story i was 13 and roughly the same size as my dad my stature had struck again maybe if they did not drink so much they could have seen that i was my dad tldr semi drunk parent thinks i am my dad,0,430

day 2 of my learning thingy too long i did not read my progress bar basically did not move at all layman terms did some research hit a dead end am retracing my steps but i lost a lot of time today i was just browsing through youtube a little more to see if there are already tetris ai that i could use my target is tetr io so i was seeing if there is any ai for that website so i found this tetris ai guide that apparently the comments are bashing the video for plagiarising the code and that the guy teaching sucks at explaining i might still try it out though i found another guy with a tetris ai as well might do that too then i found another video about cold clear it is wayy too complicated for me i tried using their discord and asking how does one operate this ai and oh boy let me list them maybe 1 the ai was coded in rust a programming language i have intellij and visual studio code as the interpreter basically something to let me look at the code of this ai and boy do rust hate visual code on windows i do not know how to put rust into intellij have not tried it also i am not learning another programming language screw that 2 to use this thing is hard i am going to have to search through thousands of lines of code and reverse engineer it so that i can figure out what the hell does each folder of scripts do oh boy i am too inexperienced for that 3 i am not even that advanced i asked and one of the discord member told me how to run the ai using python i mean i could also just download another application in that discord and run it but apparently if i want to use python i got to use experience to know how to use the ai in a web browser there is no tutorial for this or at least not that i could think of 4 i was overwhelmed by the info that i just spent 5 hours on youtube and other games including tetris because my brain just needs to rest i could absorb anymore info for today at least i am starting java script with code academy let us see where that takes me,0,405

self love is so important one of the important aspects of self love is knowing when someone is treating you right wrong in a relationship i see this happen a lot where someone will be stuck on someone that does not treat them right such as always making them upset makes them feel unloved and other negative emotions self love is important to gain so you can easily notice when someone is not treating you right what is the point of staying with someone when they make you feel like shit there is so many people in this world there is no reason to settle for someone that makes you sad and when can be with someone that makes you happy and treats you the way you want to be treated i do not know i felt compelled to write this because i have been talking to my friend about their situation relating to this for awhile,0,157

i do not understand how people generalise other people so much i was having this discussion with my parents the other day and i understand that generalisation happens to every group of people but why though why is it normal to form preconceived notions about someone based on one thing you found out about them people always get upset when they are generalised because of their race religion and so on but then they do the exact same thing i understand we can all be unintentionally hypocritical but why are not you at least trying to be part of the solution people really do not want to because treat everyone as an individual and just because they are a part of a certain group does not mean they behave the way you believe people in that group should behave i just wish people could genuinely love each other why do we take every opportunity to find reasons why we should hate each other if you actually read this far then i wanted to say that i love you even if we do not have the same beliefs or like the same things i still love you have a great day,0,200

my boyfriend will not dress up as a grinch i have a grinch fetish my boyfriend knows about this and for the most part accepts it he is not crazy about it and does not really get it but he at least tries which is all i ask he will sometimes read the book to me to set the mood or if he is really feeling kinky tell me you are a mean one in the heat of the moment he is even begrudgingly come around to at least playing one of the three versions of the film every time we do the deed although we tend to stay away from the live action one because it is too much for me the thing is i do not want to hear about the grinch or listen to the grinch or watch the grinch i want to be fucked by the grinch and for the record this is common among women the grinch s bulging sack of toys to me and many others is what a mack truck is to cardi b the fact that he is good with dogs and experienced trauma at a young age makes me want that long fuzzy dick even more my boyfriend asked me what i wanted for christmas and i told him straight up i told him to put on the greenest silkiest grinch costume he could find kidnap me from my bed on christmas eve and then ravage me in front of the christmas tree he flat out refused said it was too weird for him i was literally begging this man to let this pussy save christmas and he was like nah i am good it ended up turning into a fight where he admitted he only gave into my initial grinch kinks to placate me and was still uncomfortable about the fact that i had moaned grinch during sex a few weeks ago but only because his song was playing in the background so he is drawn a line and if i do not drop the grinch fetish which as i said is incredibly common among women but sadly taboo he is done for good i do not want to lose him over this but it is really hard for me to see past my sexual proclivities especially during christmas season is there any way we can even compromise on this or do i simply need a more adventurous man,0,409

the pandemic was the best thing that happened to me i hate school i fucking hate school and i always hated the routine of having to wake up early to experience literal torture and then get home late not having time to do anything i like to get in bed early and then repeat everything for years and years aaaaaaaaahrghhhhhh my head was drained and i just wanted to get out of this endless pain and then i heard that schools were going to close and my hapiness was there after all that pain besides the excessive amount of work that teachers send i prefer anything just to not having to go to school and obviously i do not like that people are dying that is horrible but the feeling of not leaving home is so satisfying to me and everytime i hear in the news that we are maybe going back to school i feel fear a pain in my heart it is hard to explain it was what my head needed and i really needed this for me i do not understand how everyone wants to go back honestly if you lost someone to covid i am really sorry and i wish you and your family the best,0,210
i need advice this past year has been really tough for me the first event would be my grandmother passing away i was really close to her and i pretty much spent all my weekends with her i had always had nightmare about losing her and one day she went to the icu wish i could have actually said bye my last words with her were goodnight after that happened i started having dreams of her doing what we usually did on weekends i e cooking watching tv etc i eventually moved on from that with the help of my friends and family fast forward a couple months i get really into my science olympiad team and we actually made it to the state competition and then coronavirus cancelled it 4 days before actual competition not that big of a deal right i mean it is kind of bad but i can move on i move on to online school that ends without a hitch then i meet this girl who i have a class with via social media and we start talking a lot actually until after 3 months of back and forth i get ghosted i finally say after a week a ghosting to tell her my true feelings i get ok lol and yeah i am not the best looking or smartest person ever so i respect her decision and move on but it really hit me hard a month later my bearded dragon which i have had since 2nd grade is diagnosed with terminal bone cancer this is basically where i am now i am taking the best care i can of my beardie making sure he is comfortable a lot of time i just think to myself if there is ever anyone watching out for me if i am worth anything i have always been overweight so i have started to work out and that is a big stress reliever and thing have gotten a little better but i need advice on how i can improve myself to be more likable also i need advice on how to deal with grief and the fear of losing someone thank you for reading i hope you have a great day,0,373

online school s got me feeling down when we had the no harm policy in the last months before my freshman year ended it was all good i just stopped doing work and my grades just stayed good now that a new year started it is not as fun as i imagined every time i go into a zoom call i just cannot resist opening up a game instead of listening when the homework gets assigned on classroom either i forget about it entirely or i just do not feel like i want to do it my aunt used to check on my grades daily but since 8th grade she probably thinks that i have a grip on my grades but in reality my grades are awful and i only have one b and a couple d s and f s she is been nice to me all this time but if she opened up my grades now all the trust will be gone i feel bad because she said that my grades were good last year but that was only because of the no harm policy do not get me wrong not having to wear stylish clothes and having the ability to play games the instant school ends is nice but this is at the expense of my grades amp  x200b edit q1 is ending next week and i am terrified that the school will email my parents seeing email after email of teacher name here just returned your assignment 0 20  is super demoralizing,0,256

advice from a girl about girls in the past few days i have seen posts about boys giving advice about dating boys and i am female and i thought i would give it a shot english is not my native language so i am sorry if there are spelling and grammar mistakes also i might have forgotten a few things so feel free to make your own post with things that i forgot a lot of girls are very insecure about themselves especially because of during puberty so it is feels really good to be complimented and reassured that we do not look like a mess you should try to be as friendly as possible a lot of people say that nice guys finish last but that is not true it is very refreshing to have an actually nice person it is great if your so is also like your best friend someone who is understanding and always there for you we like affection but we are often afraid that we are too clingy it is great if you hug us first or a little kiss on a cheek it can literally make our day we also do not even need sex it is completely overrated a lot of girls are super afraid of their first time and show her or tell her that you can wait for her until she is ready you should try to find out what a girls interests are you do not need to pretend to love it but at least show a little interest i think it is super attractive when a guy is interested in the same things as me i also have something that you should try to avoid please do not send anyone dick pics without consent there is just no good ducking angle for that there are a lot of other ways to show a girl that you are interested in her it is just creepy and it feels kind of like sexual harassment,0,334

will pedophilia happen to be normalized in the future pedophilia is not something new we all have been sickened or rather even angered by the very existence of it however in the recent past weeks a large number of social media accounts news articles and even memes have been discussing the very topic of the so called maps self identified maps aka pedophiles and how they are trying to normalize themselves by trying to get along with lgbtq communities and even going as far as creating a flag to represent themselves personally as a person who is extremely critical to topics of pedophilia and rape i was sickened and was worried in a recent talk with one of my friends about these topics we saw how people of lgbtq communities were oppressed and were often hated and harassed by the general public and how it can still be seen in our older generation such as our grandparents and even our peers often labeling them as unnatural  i was told about how just like in the past the people who hated lgbtq communities are now considered conservative and parochial one day we might be too be seen like this but in this case it would be due to our disagreement with the very presence of pedophiles countless underaged children are being abused and over sexualize for the sake of entertainment and fame by their parents and guardians and it has provided with a means of media for these pedophiles and you can virtually find child porn in literally any hentai japanese pornographic art labeled as loli available at one click away will in the future after common interaction of people about such sensitive topics make them numb and result in pedophilia to become destigmatized and be a thing of the future and we have to stay quiet about it i as a person is genuinely scared and angered with the very possibility and the helplessness i feel please let me know what you think too long i did not read will pedophilia become common and legalized and we will be known as the boomers of the future generations,0,357

my parents do not let me spend my own money alright maybe not the correct place to ask but i figured you all must have experience on this i am currently 15 and i have saved money for myself my whole life money i got from birthdays christmas and other stuff i have a pretty hefty amount saved there almost 4 digit numbers i have a game that i really like and i want to buy a skin to support the developers on top of being my favorite skin the skin costs 25 flame me all you want but my money my choice remember that they say i need to save money for my drivers license but thanks to my hardworking grandfather who unfortunately is not here with us anymore who worked all his life to make mine and my mum s life easier there is a separate bank account with money for my loans car and drivers license so i did not need to save for these things she literally hid the money somewhere i cannot find and if i ask to use her own money she is going to ask my dad who no way in fucking hell is going to let me even if it was 99 cents i also want to spend money on a new mouse and on generally things i want and that make me happy since mine is literally broke and i really need one for school work but i talk to her and she is like too expensive 45 mouse by the way not expensive at all considering what i am getting and if i talk back to her with valid arguments you are ungrateful my house my rules do not talk back i see my friends having fun in some games that i cannot even buy because i cannot use my money and my parents do not let me use theirs i know there is the point of teaching me money management but firstly i have been taught very well to spend it only on things that i need and rarely on things that we want not never but not everyday either and secondly for me to test my money management i need to have money to manage in the first place how do i talk to her without getting the you are ungrateful my house my rules do not talk back as well as getting grounded and not being able to do anything electronic wise for 1 motnh its literally all i have to entertain myself as well as being able to buy things i want need thanks boys and girls,0,441

in the hour of the night the mists settle for the camouflaged stars and blushing horizon the harsh desert stretching before you as you stare restless at the beauty that has become stale in its consistency a land collapses with a thud a wave so mighty it seems unstoppable but one so solitary it abandons hope and gets laid to rest upon the twinkling waters this land is dying the beauty you have come to ignore is wrinkling the sky and land sour in response to the greed and shortsightedness of humanity and despair grips you as you come to realize there is nothing to be done the cancer cannot be removed it grows with steady powerful strides as it obliterates and corrupts everything it touches you search for the long since abandoned beauty and find it has become lost among your distractions you decide to forget why think about the inevitable when understanding and contemplation do nothing ignorance as it turns out is indeed bliss,0,166

how to masturbate for men you really do not have to masturbate if you do not want to no actual benefits but if you do want to here is how to do it cannot believe i am typing this but let us go there are 2 methods for male masturbation there is anal but i have never done it and i am not knowledged in the slightest about it standing and laying however you can perform the standing technic laying and the laying technic standing it is just refering to how they are most commonly performed first for all find some time to do it i suggest getting about 30 minutes of free time then find someplace where your semen will not be a problem and is not shared by anyone else other than someone you are in a relationship with then get something to clean it a good wipe will do you can then find something to do it to it does not have to be porn or lewd does not even have to be a picture you can even use your imagination although keep in mind it is easy to get distracted then do it in hours when you will not fall asleep during the masturbation sadly i am guilty of that one also do it fully naked you do not want stains on your clothes you can also use a form of lubrication but that is optional unless you are doing anal stimulation now on how to do the standing method get in a comfortable position then undress yourself get a grasp of your penis in your palm and start stroking it as gentle rough or however you feel like do not worry no harm will be done to your foreskin just keep going whilst slightly stroking faster and faster until you ejaculate that really is it all now on how to do the laying method undress yourself and find a soft object then just rub your penis or your entire body on that object until you ejaculate keep in mind that that object will get stained no matter how much you try not to stain it that is pretty much it now if you do not know what ejaculation feels like do not worry you will know it when it happens if you want to know how sperm is supposed to look like fresh out of the penis break and egg in a bowl and look at the transparent liquid imagine this but white now sperm is going to be sticky smells surprisingly like cleaning chemicals and taste like bugger do not ask how i know the last one and do not attempt to taste it and that is it now go on and masturbate,0,459

getting over a quick crush feel free to roast me for this i know it is stupid everyone important in this post is 18 i admit i am a simp anyways i have followed this guy on tiktok for a while i thought he was funny cute and we had some things in common so he held my interest i am gay by the way i do not know anything about his sexuality i commented on most posts for the clout and eventually he began to respond and expect my comments whenever he would post one of those you know the kind concerning 3am tiktoks that get deleted in the morning i would direct message him and write a quick message to make sure he is alright that was pretty much it i did not want anything from him i was just bored and he is similar to me so i felt a connection after some time he began calling me by my first name in comments and dms so i think we were friends ish he hosted a zoom call for his viewers and insisted that i join even though it took me forever because my zoom was glitchy it was the first time we would met face to face and he seemed really happy to see me i was nervous obviously because a tiktok crush was becoming very real very fast i mostly was on my phone because i could not stand the kids in the call but had nothing else to do eventually he private messaged me on the zoom asking for my snapchat which surprised me after a few hours of the very few older people talking and laughing with at the little kids he claimed that he was ending the call and going to bed then he booted out the kids and it was left with four girls and us two we all stayed in the call for a few more hours and it was pretty fun he kept teasing me about being a simp and i admit i could not really defend myself that well it was very late and we eventually ended the call him and i starting snapchatting for while that night he told me that he knew i was flirting with him and tried to get me to admit i was simping for him i teased him back and eventually i admitted that i found him cute he called me cute back we kind of started flirting he started asking me some questions about being gay so i think he had recently started questioning or something similar he asked a question that took a lot of time to answer so i asked if i could just call him we called for a bit until i had to leave my house to watch the sunrise with my friend regretfully my connection faltered once i left the house so i sent him my number and he gave me his we called until i had to go in retrospect i should not have hung up at all we snapped casually throughout the day and he did not respond to my attempts to conversate as much as i would like everyone called again last night but we did not flirt or snap it was all friendly though i really like this guy but my feelings are all confused i have never had an online crush actually become friends with me much less respond as he did but now i think that might be over and i am left thinking if i did something or if things could have been better if i would stayed on the call why did not i do that people are not talking in the chat with all the people from the first zoom call and i am getting a little anxious i hate that i form attachments this easily and now i am left being confused i guess in conclusion i kind of fell for someone who does not even live near me but who connected and flirted with me for a night i know that is very inconsequential but it was personal and not a quick thing i hope i do not want to be annoying or a bother and try to talk to him again because that may be the case i tried to make this short but i clearly suck at that anyone got any online crush advice,0,741

yo how is it possible that almost every person i meet in real life is like a 3 10 on the concerned with covid scale and yet almost everyone on reddit is a 10 10 and acting like the world is literally about to end they take it serious enough to wear a mask and follow some of the guidelines but unlike what i see all over social media they have not allowed it to take over their entire lives and turn them into angry isolated weirdos who think the entire planet is about to drop dead it just does not seem organic either social media has a massive issue with bots trying to influence public opinion or social media is mostly filled with delusional shut ins i am not sure which but either way something is up because my reality is not even close to matching what i constantly see online which is all the time doom and gloom,0,160

worst feeling is not your crush being in a relationship it is when she actively picks someone over you when she is not taken just came back from a sleepover and wanted to share this somewhere just did not know where we were in a group of friends mostly girls including my crush but also one guy the entire evening everyone was pretty close and cuddling besides me my social battery was pretty low already but it was just completely drained when i realised how she actively tried to avoid me and instead stayed almost exclusively with the other guy they did ask me to come over once but that came from him and it looked like she did not want it every time i tried to come close to her she moved to the side to avoid even touching me we have been talking for ages now but it always starts with me taking the initiative she never messages me first she never even continues streaks on snap the one time we met up alone i asked her out i just want to cry or do shit but i have no clue what thanks if anyone read this far i just wanted to get this off my chest,0,209

my lifelong best friend is being a dick to me over something as stupid as politics we go to the same church he is a christian i am a closited agnostic he is a republican full on trump supporter and whatnot and i disagree with alot of his beliefs but that has never stopped me from respecting his opinion the thing is we are not even that different in terms of political beliefs i am a libertarian so economically speaking i am still very right wing i just do not believe in stupid shit like being anti mask or supporting trump i do not even hate trump i just do not support him but he thinks just because i support things like drug legalization which i am very strongly for and wearing masks i am some sort of liberal leftist as if that is supposed to be an insult because of course all libt rds are stupid sjw s who need to be wrecked by facts and logic s recently all that he and his own conservative friends republicunts if you will have been messaging me and shitting on my political views despite the fact that they provide no real factual arguments and any arguments they did provide i instantly discredited and provided my own counter argument which made them heated and angry while i maintained a cool head it was quite entertaining actually but still very annoying well i think it is time to cut this kid out of my life which is going to be really hard cus he was my best friend for years and i have been nothing but respectful to him and meanwhile especially since he introduced me to some other friends that he had he is been acting more and more like an absolute cunt why are people like this also please note that this post is not an attack on republicans my policy on others political beliefs is that if your arguments and viewpoints are grounded in facts and logic and you are able to have a civil productive discussion about them with others you have my respect i do not care if you are on the left or right or whatever so long as you are not a literal nazi or something,0,380

casual reminder less than 12 hours left for our global mass meditation for establishing planetary divine governance tl dr the outcome of the ongoing us elections will affect all humanity whether they like it or not so do join us all in the global meditation for setting up divine governance in the us and everywhere else a meditation that seeks to force a divinely inspired outcome for the highest benefit of all living beings as opposed to electing some specific person or party this mass global meditation will take place on the 29th of october 2020 at 11 11 am pacific daylight time click here to quickly check the timing conversions for your local time zone though you all are highly advised to keep doing this whenever you so get the time for doing this hereafter even sparing but a couple of minutes each day hereon will do wonders for the outcome of not just this election but so much more finally here is some irrefutable proof that divine transformation on such lines is already afoot even as you read this text and as such is not exactly a fairy tale dream as also some irrefutable evidence of the fact that all of this mass meditation stuff stuff truly really works a yet another epic ally additional way that you can use to serve and support the planet and its people at this time and yet another one main message begins currently the united states just so happens to be the global headquarters as well as the breeding ground playing field for all those of lesser light and lower intent these worshippers of darkness and deceit have ruled over humanity for many many eons upon eons now and basically think of us as their permanent slaves and if you have anything whatsoever to do with spirituality awakening or spiritual leanings of absolutely any sort in here then trust me these ones have gone to some extremely dark and messed up ways to shut you down did they succeed all the time clearly not but they sure as hell most definitely tried rather it is so that they have attempted to cut short your lifespan many many many more times than you would like to know in here and this is why these ongoing us elections are our one big chance to turn the tide back in the favour of love and light once again upon this beautiful planet of ours because folks no matter where you stay upon this planet this election and its results will affect you so it is more than wise to heed this message now so that you may be able to affect the outcome of this election all in your favour instead and do this you all can well without a doubt as has been proven extremely well before in here so please please do read the complete message explaining this issue in its fullest detail simply by clicking right here and please please do read it at least once in its very totality and you will all clearly see exactly as to just why this mass meditation simply had to be created for one and all around the globe to participate in and why and how it is so very critical right now that we bring love light to this election process so that the history of humanity may be rewritten forever as we all make our way right back into the light here no less remember they can censor your voice or erase your vote but they can never ever do a damn thing about your inner power to create the reality of your deepest desires know this always an important pre meditation note if you are new to mass meditation manifestation here is how it all even works all you even need to do in here is to simply imagine visualize a situation event scenario happening occurrence as best as you possibly can and then truly deeply feel all emotional feelings and even physical sensations associated with your experiencing that very scene situation all as if the said scene in question was unfolding in front of your eyes right at this very moment this is key that is pretty much it and that you keep doing tuning in this as often as you can throughout your day whenever you so get the free time to do so for maximum effect and impact finally for those of who absolutely suck at visualizing imagination worry not because at the end of the day it is only and only your intention truly feeling as if what you would desired was literally happening right now in front of you that gets the job done in here and finally if you suck at even that worry not still for you can always and always make a very simple prayer to yourself your higher self god angels galactics ascended masters etc and get that job in question done regardless or just send that situation in question a blessing for the highest outcome possible note you can do this as many times as you possibly like to get your chosen desire to come true regardless options aplenty to go around here with regards to achieving our end objective here folks the meditation step one find the most comfortable space that you can possibly manage to find for yourself before beginning this meditation note that while this is not necessarily a prerequisite it is greatly advisable nevertheless for the best effect here also note that you can freely do this meditation in any pose of your preference sitting standing sleeping whatever it is that you are the most comfortable in because the more comfy you are here the better and more so powerful shall be your meditation also advisable to set up beforehand the place of your choice prior to your meditation if this is at all possible by setting up multiple additional mind calming agents around yourselves such as calming music incenses crystals candles etc the clearer calmer and more relaxed your mind the more powerful is your meditation the meditation step two ask all higher beings and energies such as angels god ascended masters higher selves galactics passed over family and friends etc to assist and protect you infinitely during this meditation as also to amplify your intentions energies for you infinitely kindly note here that these higher beings energies are simply not permitted to do so without your express free will request approval so please give them that permission request so that your job gets done a whole lot more easily in that way and that even if when you are unable to manage a given meditation instruction on here properly that they can then step in on your behalf and do it for you instead it is a complete and total win win for all of you folks the meditation step three explicitly ask god angels your higher self to lock your energies by making sure that they are used and utilized only and only for the highest good of the whole world at large and nothing else this intention lock basically prevents anyone else from misusing stealing your free energies for their guaranteed nefarious intentions and purposes the meditation step four if required please visit the important pre meditation note provided above to re learn the method s necessary for doing this intend visualize that the us election process goes smoothly peacefully and in complete integrity and transparency in every single way and or manner imaginable the meditation step five intend visualize that the results of this election are received peacefully and lovingly and that the election in question puts into governance beings of the highest light benevolence service orientedness compassion kindness truthfulness integrity honesty peacefulness wisdom and above all true unconditional love it is suggested here that instead of visualizing actual people or candidates of your liking not that you should not be doing this that you instead visualize beings made of light or angels or saints or ascended masters or divine god essence filling up every imaginable level of your governments and bureaucratic structures right from the bottom to the top you could even imagine your self in place of the president and all of the people under him if that is whom you trust the most to have the perfect integrity and honesty and love and truth doing so will literally force any person even if it were to be the literal devil himself entering into a position of power and authority upon your world to either comply with your divine governance blueprint or effing leave z e r o exceptions the meditation step six intend visualize that as a result of your meditation and intentions that the entire world at large gets affected positively and benevolently that compassion kindness forgiveness and love take precedence over all else that there is equality for all in every way that it implies and that the entirety of human civilization becomes harmonious integrated balanced and with a brilliant camaraderie as a result of this that all man made borders and arguments and barriers and conflicts and hassles within between amongst mankind cease to exist permanently as a result of this election and that unconditional acceptance and global harmony and unity become the order of the day here that the results of this election usher in waves upon waves of tremendously positive changes for all of humanity from cleaner air and water and environment to better treatment of all living beings to planetary abundance and prosperity for all to infinitely better standards of living technologies and such to unimaginably greater levels of spiritual connection awareness consciousness awakening all across the planet to incredibly amazing and benevolent changes transformations within every single field imaginable from health and healing to food and beverages education transportation science governance and what else have you got intend imagine this divine government disclosing all truths regarding things that have ever been hidden away from mankind so that a new golden chapter within the history of planet earth may well be opened once and for all for all of us to collectively explore and enjoy in here the meditation step seven that is it you are all done in here do not forget to spend a few minutes in gratitude for thanking all benevolent beings and energies who assisted and protected you so very unconditionally and lovingly during this incredible global mass meditation of monumental proportions now go forth and enjoy your day the meditation step eight naah this is not even really a step here so to speak but more so a reminder to one and all for setting your clock alarm for this particular meditation timing and that too all according to your own specific time zone no less lest you forget this awesome thing altogether the meditation is at 11 11 am pacific daylight time on the 29th of october 2020 by the way click here to get a time zone conversion for this for your respective place s of residence though if you really cannot make it at this time try doing this at 11 11 private message pacific daylight time on the same day or if even that is not possible then at any other time throughout that very day right after making the intention that your energies intentions be added to the main mass meditation in question kindly note here that the more the numbers of people doing it all at the exact same time the more will be its power efficacy and effectiveness no less just some divine spiritual laws for ya finally do not forget to share this meditation message with every single person you know be it friends family neighbours colleagues or who else have you do reach out to your local spiritual communities awakened collectives and groups and forums and whatnot to make this happen and most certainly do speak about this in your conversations with your near and dear ones and also upon your social media platforms no less also since this whole thing simply is not about electing any specific or particular party person at all no one should really have any qualms in participating in this in any way shape or form here whatsoever i thank you all from the very bottom of my heart for this incredible and beautiful contribution to the collective consciousness of humankind may you all be infinitely blessed with infinite love light joy harmony bliss abundance and peace i thank you all for reading,0,2099

everybody please be safe on the internet usually reddit is an amazing place to meet new people but please please please be careful i just had someone try to get me to send him some very inappropriate things on this platform and i just finished reporting him to the police everybody they prey on us because they know we are insecure and vulnerable if someone starts asking or talking about inappropriate things and you are a minor collect as much information as you can do not send them anything and report them to the police they may be preying on other kids do not let them get away with it if you want to report them without your parents finding out google wetip it is a way to make an anonymous police report you never give them your name and they will not contact you further also if you report someone and they end up being arrested apparently you get a reward please if you see something do something i never want to relive that experience and i do not want anyone to ever fall victim to anyone like that again please be careful,0,194

i need to get this off of my chest ice does not belong in drinks i said it before you jump to conclusions i have prepared a list of what i like about ice and what i dislike about ice what i like haha drink is cold what i dislike i find that when drinking ice enters my throat if the ice is too big i choke for a little bit and it is unpleasant if the ice is too small it just slips down my throat this is also unpleasant ice puts a time limit on your drink oops you did not drink your coke for two minutes well now all the ice has melted and it is diluted and tastes like pee i will admit that this does not affect water you get less drink have you ever ordered a drink from a fast food place yea half of the drink is ice in conclusion ice sucks and its overrated change my mind,0,165
